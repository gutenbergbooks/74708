<h3>The Fool’s Lesson</h3>

<p>When Eulenspiegel came to Magdeburg—the
fame of his notorious pranks having preceded
him—several of the best citizens asked
him to give them a sample of his buffoonery.
He said he would do so, and promised to fly
from the roof of a house on the market place.
The news spread rapidly, and old and young
hurried there to see him fly. For some time
Eulenspiegel stood on the low roof, moving his
arms and acting as if he were going to fly, then
he burst out laughing and cried: “I thought I
was the only fool in the world, but I see that
here are almost a whole city full of them. If
you had told me that you were going to fly, I
should not have believed you; and yet you believed
me, a well-known fool. How should I
be able to fly? I am neither a goose nor any
other kind of a bird. I have no wings, and
without wings and feathers nobody can fly.
Now you see, I told you a falsehood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>He turned and left the roof, while the crowd
separated, some laughing, some swearing, but
all agreeing, that though he was a fool, he had
told them the truth.</p>

<h3>The Wisdom of a Fool</h3>

<p>“A fool may sometimes be a better judge
than a wise man,” writes Johannes Andrea of a
fool. Once a beggar entered the kitchen of a
tavern. A large piece of meat was roasting on
the spit, and the poor man took his bread from
his pocket and held it over the roast, so the
odor would penetrate it, then he ate it. When
all his bread was gone he turned to leave, but
the host went after him and demanded his pay.
The poor man said, “You did not give me
either meat or drink; so what should I pay
you for?”</p>

<p>The host replied, “You feasted on what was
mine, on the odor of the roast, and you shall
pay me for that.”</p>

<p>They went to court about it, but judgment
was suspended, until next court-day. Now one
of the judges had a fool at home, and at dinner
this case was talked about. Said the fool:
“Pay the host with the jingle of the money, as
the poor man feasted on the odor of the roast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>When court-day came around the fool’s advice
was followed.</p>

<h3>A Good Shot</h3>

<p>A man passing through a forest, saw an old
blind bear. A young bear, whose tail was in
the old bear’s mouth, led him. The man took
his gun and shot the young bear’s tail off.
Then he took hold of it and led the blind bear
for two miles to market at Stuttgart.</p>

<h3>The One-legged Crane</h3>

<p>A knight invited his father-confessor to dinner.
The holy father arrived while the knight
was still at church, and being hungry went to
the kitchen where all kinds of meat were roasting.
He said to the cook: “The roasts are
now at their best; give me a leg from this crane
and then I’ll wait for dinner.” But the cook
replied: “I cannot do that; my master would
send me away if I brought the bird, mutilated
like that, to the table. Take it yourself, then
he cannot blame me.”</p>

<p>The confessor took a knife and cut the leg
off, had the cook give him bread and wine, and
sat down to enjoy it. At dinner the crane was
served lying on his wounded side. The knight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
asked at once in an angry tone: “Where is the
other leg?” His confessor, who sat next to
him, whispered to him to keep quiet before his
guests, that after dinner he would prove to him
that the bird had only had one leg.</p>

<p>As soon as dinner was over, the knight asked
his confessor to take a walk with him. They
went outside the town. On the way the knight
said: “You insisted that the bird had only one
leg; how is that?” “I will show you,” returned
the confessor, and took him to a meadow
where between thirty and forty cranes were
standing, all, as usual, on one leg. Pointing to
them he said: “Look, all those birds have only
one leg.” The knight clapped his hands and
chased them. The cranes grew frightened,
stretched their necks, put down their feet, and
ran. Said the knight to the confessor: “How
now? You see that they have two legs?”
Says the confessor: “Dear sir, if you had
clapped your hands like this at the table, the
other leg would have put in an appearance too.”</p>

<h3>Justice Obscured by a Pig</h3>

<p>There was a poor widow, who had a case at
court. She brought to the judge a little pot of
sour cream; he was to protect her cause. He
bade her hope for the best and said that she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
a good case, and need not worry. She was
glad.</p>

<p>Then came the opponent. He was rich, and
brought the judge a young pig. When the case
came up, the woman lost her suit. She went to
the judge and said: “Sir, where is my little
pot of cream?” He answered: “The little
pig knocked it over.”</p>

<h3>The Farmer’s Belief</h3>

<p>A farmer went to confession and the priest
asked him if he knew anything about the Trinity.
The good man knew nothing about it. The
priest did his best to explain it to him and at
last said: “My good friend, to make it still
plainer to you, imagine yourself God the Father,
respect your son as if he were the Son of God,
and take your wife to be the Holy Ghost. Now
remember, you three are as one. You are one
household and live together; that makes a
trinity.” With this the good man went home.</p>

<p>A year later, he came again to confess. The
priest asked him at once whether he believed
now in a trinity. “No,” said the farmer, “I
only believe in the first two, the Father and the
Son, in those two I believe firmly. In the Holy
Ghost I don’t believe at all; for everything that
the Father and the Son gain by hard, heavy
labor, the Holy Ghost squanders and spends.”
The priest had to give up trying to enlighten the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
good farmer. He absolved him and let him depart.</p>

<h3>The Monk’s Trick</h3>

<p>A nobleman was walking across the country
with a barefooted monk. They came to a brook
and found the bridge had disappeared. The
nobleman asked the monk, as he was without
shoes, to carry him across. The monk did so,
but when they were in the middle of the brook
he asked the nobleman if he had any money
with him. He answered: “Yes.”—“Oh,”
said the monk, “we are forbidden to carry
money,” and dropped the nobleman into the
brook.</p>

<h3>A Brief Sermon</h3>

<p>A priest who had not studied much, came into
the pulpit and said: “I will briefly speak of
three things to-day. The first I know, and you
do not. The second you know, and I do not.
The third none of us knows. That my trousers
are torn, I know. Whether you are going to
give me a new pair, you know. Our sexton had
a fresh barrel of beer put in; but whether that
beer is good, none of us knows; so come along
and let us taste it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<h3>A Bright Reply</h3>

<p>Three young noblemen were riding by a field
in which a farmer was working among his cabbages.
They rode up to him, and one said:
“My good man, what will you give us, if we
prove to you that you are a cabbage?” The
farmer answered: “Nothing, for I can do those
tricks as well as you. Now I can prove to you,
that your saddles are mules.” At this the young
sparks shouted with laughter and said: “Well,
tell us all about it.” The farmer answered:
“Why, all my life, I have known that anything
between a horse and an ass has been called a
mule.”</p>

<h3>A Large Recipe</h3>

<p>A good but stupid countryman stopped with
his farm wagon before a drug-store in the town,
and began to unload a big, heavy door. The
druggist, much surprised, said: “What do you
want with that here? The carpenter lives over
there.” Said the farmer: “It is all right. My
wife is ill, the doctor has been to see her and
wrote the prescription with chalk on this door, as
we had no pen and ink. Now, sir, please make
it up. I am in a great hurry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<h3>A Trapful</h3>

<p>“Once I caught in my trap a wild duck, a fox,
and a nine pound carp.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“Near the pond, a fox saw a duck; he sneaked
up to catch her. Springing at her, he caught
her by the wing, but the duck managed to get
into the water. The fox holding on to her wing
followed her; but a big carp swam up behind
and bit him in his leg. The fox closes his claws
so tight on the carp that it cannot get away
again. Now the trap was close by, and the
duck fluttered into it. The fox not willing to
lose her, follows in and pulls the carp after
him.”</p>

<h3>His Turn</h3>

<p>A woman whose little child would not go to
sleep at night, wakened her husband, to take his
turn for a while in nursing it, as it was as much
his part as hers. “You are right,” said the
husband, turning on his other side, “you rock
your part, I’ll let mine scream.”</p>

<h3>A Sympathetic Parson</h3>

<p>A parson preached in Holy week so touchingly
about the Lord’s suffering, that the whole congregation
began to sob. Then the minister, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
was a very tender-hearted man and did not like
to see anybody weep, said: “My dear friends, be
comforted; it all happened so long ago, who
knows whether it is true.”</p>

<h3>Delayed Justice</h3>

<p>Once a farmer complained to his minister, that
his landlord persecuted him most shamefully.
The parson comforted the farmer saying: “The
pitcher goes to the well until it breaks; and if
he does not get his just punishment in this world
he will surely suffer all the more in the next.”
Answered the farmer: “Yes, but if the rascal
repents on his deathbed, what then?”</p>

<h3>Luck</h3>

<p>The minister, in the scripture lesson at school,
had been explaining the miracles, and finally
asked a boy: “Jacob, your father is a roofer.
What would you call it, if you came home, and
heard that your father had fallen from the roof
of the church tower, without breaking his neck?”</p>

<p>“Luck.”</p>

<p>“So, luck? But if you came home a second
time and heard the same thing?”</p>

<p>“An accident.”</p>

<p>“But the third time?”</p>

<p>“A lie, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<h3>Somewhat Mixed</h3>

<p>An amiable host had to send late at night for
a carriage to take home his four friends, who
had taken too much of his wine. He gave the
driver the street and house number of each one,
and went to bed. He was in his first sleep
when his door-bell was rung violently.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” he called from his
window, seeing that the carriage with his guests
had returned.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” cries the driver, “please sort them
out once more for me; they got all mixed up!”</p>

<h3>The Wrong Man</h3>

<p>A monk, a farmer, and a barber met on a
journey. At night they went into a tavern, but
when it was time to go to sleep the barber said:
“Listen, friends, to me; this place looks suspicious.
I hope they won’t rob us in the night.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented the monk, “I don’t feel easy
about it either; but what can we do? We can’t
sit here all night, we are all three dog-tired.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what we can do,” answered the
barber. “One of us must watch while the
others sleep. We will draw lots who shall be
first, second, and third watch.”</p>

<p>The monk and the farmer agreed to this.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Lots were drawn, and the barber was to watch
first, the farmer second, and the monk last.
The barber kept watch faithfully, and after he
had done everything to keep awake he took
from his bundle his scissors and other tools and
soaped the farmer’s head and then shaved it as
bald as the monk’s. When his time was up he
shook the farmer and called: “Get up, man,
it is your turn now!”</p>

<p>The farmer awoke, but when, still stupid with
sleep, he put his hand to his head and found no
hair, he grew angry and cried: “What a fool
that barber is; he was to waken me, and he has
wakened the monk instead.”</p>

<h3>The Rogue’s Coat</h3>

<p>A hypocrite came into a shop where clothes
were sold, and asked for a coat. Different
kinds were shown to him, but none pleased him.
“I need one that is black on one side and white
on the other, but of the same material on both
sides.”</p>

<p>“Strange,” said the merchant; “by your
face I judge you to be an honest man, and yet
you ask—how shall I express it?—well, frankly,
for a rogue’s coat.”</p>

<p>“But, my goodness!” replied the buyer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
smilingly, “don’t you know at all in what kind
of a world we are living? You can’t get along
with one coat. The pulpit demands one kind,
the court-house another, the café another, the
office another, the platform another, the assembly
another, the bedroom another. If you meet
ten people within five minutes it is possible that
you will have to turn your coat ten times.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” murmured the merchant, a
simple, honest German, “but if the devil gets
you in a black coat, what good will a white one
do you?”</p>

<h3>His Wiser Half</h3>

<p>A man had loaned to another fifty gulden,
but having a poor memory he had forgotten who
had borrowed it. He was much worried about
it and told his wife. She was clever, as all
women are, and told him what to do. “Go, to-morrow
morning early, through the town,” said
she, “and whenever a friend or acquaintance
bids you good day, answer, ‘Thank you, but I
would rather have ready money.’”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” said he man, and went out early
next morning. Everybody took his answer for
fun, until he met his debtor.</p>

<p>“This is an insult,” said he. “I don’t care to
owe anything to anybody who reminds me of it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
in such a rude way,” and gave the money back
at once.</p>

<h3>Adventures of Baron von Munchhausen</h3>

<p>“When at last my parents gave their consent
to my traveling, my uncle took me on a
trip to Ceylon. Our vessel arrived there after a
stormy voyage of six weeks. About two weeks
after our arrival the Governor’s son asked me to
go hunting with him. I accepted the invitation.
Now my friend was a big, strong man, used to
the heat, but I, unused to it, soon grew tired
and lagged behind.</p>

<p>“I was just going to sit down by the shore of
a raging river, when I heard a noise behind me
on the road. I looked back and saw an immense
lion coming towards me, who plainly indicated
that he meant to make his breakfast off
me, without waiting even to ask my permission.
My gun was loaded only with shot. I had no
time to think, and in my confusion I determined
to fire at the beast in the hope of frightening
him away. But in my anxiety I did not
wait until the lion came within the range of my
gun. The noise made him furious, and he came
at me with a rush. More from instinct than
sober reflection, I turned to run, but—even now
it makes me shudder to think of it—a few feet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
from me stood a horrible crocodile, with mouth
wide open, ready to swallow me.</p>

<p>“Just imagine, gentlemen, the frightful position
I was in! Behind me the lion, before me
the crocodile, to my left a raging river, to my
right an abyss, in whose depths, as I afterwards
learned, the most poisonous snakes abounded.
Almost fainting I dropped to the ground. In a
few moments I heard a loud, strange noise.
When at last I dared to raise my head to look
around, what do you think had happened?
The immense force with which the lion jumped,
the moment I dropped to the ground, had
carried him over and beyond me, straight into
the crocodile’s open mouth. The head of the
one stuck in the throat of the other, and they
fought with all their might to get away from
each other. I sprang up just in time, drew my
hunting knife and, with one stroke, severed the
lion’s head, the body falling at my feet. Then
I took my gun and rammed the head down
further into the crocodile’s throat, choking him
to death.</p>

<p>“Soon after I had gained this great victory
over two terrible foes, my friend returned to see
what had become of me. After congratulations
we measured the crocodile and found his length
to be forty feet, seven inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>“As soon as we had told this extraordinary
adventure to the Governor, he sent several men
with a wagon to fetch the two animals to his
house.</p>

<p>“From the lion’s skin I had a furrier make
tobacco pouches, some of which I presented to
my friends. The crocodile was stuffed and
mounted, and is now one of the greatest curiosities
of the museum at Amsterdam.”</p>

<h3>Munchhausen’s Partridges</h3>

<p>“One day I went into the woods to try a
new gun, and had used up all my ammunition
when a covey of partridges rose from almost
under my feet. The desire to have a few
of them on my dinner table that night gave me
a bright idea. As soon as I saw where the
birds lit, I loaded my gun, but instead of shot I
put in the ramrod, which I had pointed at the
upper end as well as I could in a hurry. Then
I went towards the birds, pulled the trigger
as they flushed, and had the pleasure of seeing
seven spitted on my ramrod. As I tell you,
gentlemen, there is nothing like being able to
help oneself.”</p>

<h3>Munchhausen’s Black Fox</h3>

<p>“Another time, in a forest in Russia, I came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
across a magnificent black fox. Shooting him
would never do, as it would spoil his beautiful
fur. Now, Mr. Fox stood close to a tree. Instantly
I took the bullet from my gun and put
in its place a large nail, fired, and hit him
so skilfully that his tail was nailed to the tree.
I went quietly up to him, took my hunting-knife,
made a cross cut over his face, took
my whip and beat him out of his beautiful fur
so nicely that it was a joy and a real wonder to
see.”</p>

<i>For Gunners</i></h2>

</div>

<h3>An Enthusiastic Nimrod</h3>

<p>The night before the opening of the partridge
season, a gunner and his dog were crouching
under some bushes. The time was five minutes
to twelve. The dog was getting restless.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Feldman—only five minutes more—and
then we can go for them!”</p>

<h3>Pleasure of Tiger Hunting</h3>

<p>A gentleman who had spent some time in
India and had been on several tiger hunts, was
asked whether he found it pleasant sport.
“Oh,” he replied, “it is very pleasant sport as
long as you are chasing the tiger, but should he
happen to chase you, it has its drawbacks.”</p>

<h3>A Staff as a Firearm</h3>

<p>A poor Jew was tramping through a forest.
Suddenly a wolf came running towards him.
Dreadfully frightened the Jew raised his staff,
but fortunately at the same moment, a hunter
who was lurking behind some bushes, shot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
at the wolf and killed him. “God’s blessing,”
cried the Jew, who did not see the gunner, but
had heard the shot: “I have carried this staff
for twenty years, and never knew that it was
loaded!”</p>

<h3>A Master Shot</h3>

<p>“Something remarkable happened to me
yesterday. I went gunning and saw two
rabbits, about twenty-five feet apart, taking
a nap in the grass. Now what to do to get
them, I hardly knew. Quickly I pulled the two
barrels of my gun apart, drew the trigger and
both rabbits were mine.”</p>

<h3>Recognized</h3>

<p>A, relating his first gunning adventure:—“What
do you think of this, gentlemen! Some
time ago, while I was on the lookout for game,
along comes a rabbit and sits down not far from
me. I shoot, but the rabbit does not move. I
shoot again, but still the rabbit does not budge.
Now my patience is at an end. I run towards
him, and when I get close enough to knock him
down, up rises my rabbit and is off. Now
how do you explain this, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>Old Gunner:—“Well, that rabbit read you
all right. He thought: As long as he only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
shoots, there is no danger; but when he comes
himself, then it’s time to skip.”</p>

<h3>Never at a Loss</h3>

<p>Gunner:—“You always insisted that your
old gun did not shoot straight, but now that you
have a new one, you don’t seem to hit anything,
either.”</p>

<p>Sunday Gunner:—“Yes, but now the rabbits
don’t run straight.”</p>

<h3>A Malicious Proposition</h3>

<p>Gunner:—“I should just like to know
whether that dark speck over there is a driver
or a deer.”</p>

<p>Förster:—“We can soon find out. You
just shoot at it; if you hit it, it is a driver; if
you don’t, it’s certain that it is a deer.”</p>

<h3>He Wanted Witnesses</h3>

<p>Gunner (who has shot a rabbit at last):—“Oh,
for some witnesses to this!”</p>

<h3>Enlightened Him</h3>

<p>Baron (to his neighbor at a pheasant hunt):—“Did
you not notice; I hit that pheasant—the
feathers flew!”</p>

<p>Förster:—“Yes, I saw it—so did the
pheasant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<h3>The Stolen Deer</h3>

<p>Poacher:—“Your Reverence, I have a beautiful
deer for sale.”</p>

<p>His Reverence:—“A deer? What? Did
you say a deer, Seppel? How long is it since I
reasoned with you and tried to make you understand
what a bad fellow you are! Did I not
tell you that if you shoot a deer, you commit a
great crime and that such a deer is as good as
stolen? My, but I am angry! Seppel, take
that deer right to the kitchen, I don’t want to
see any more of it.”</p>

<h3>A Poor Excuse</h3>

<p>Förster:—“Now I have caught you—what
are you doing here with that gun?”</p>

<p>Poacher:—“Oh, my! Herr Förster, I am so
down on my luck, that I thought I’d just go
into the woods and shoot—myself.”</p>

<h3>A Gunner’s Memory</h3>

<p>A:—“Have you heard the news? The Oberförster
shot four deer yesterday!”</p>

<p>B:—“He told me he got two.”</p>

<p>A:—“Is that possible? Why, I spoke to
him only about five minutes ago, at the Golden
Star Inn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>B:—“Oh, that explains it. I spoke to him
half an hour ago.”</p>

<h3>Improving Opportunities</h3>

<p>Clerk (to his principal):—“Can I have this
afternoon off, sir,—an old aunt of mine is to be
buried?”</p>

<p>Principal:—“Very well, but the next time
you bury an aunt, you might bring me a couple
of rabbits.”</p>

<h3>A Gunning Yarn</h3>

<p>A gentleman just returned from Brazil, boasted
of the many gorillas he had killed there.
“That must have been very difficult,” remarked
one of the listeners.</p>

<p>“It certainly was,” said the narrator, “but I
knew how to take advantage of the monkey’s
passion for imitating us.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“It was very simple. In places where I suspected
the presence of gorillas, I loaded a pistol
with a blind cartridge, turned it upon myself
and fired; then I left a heavily loaded one on
the ground and retired. Returning to the place
later on, I invariably found the carcass of a
gorilla, who had shot himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<h3>A Sign of Recognition</h3>

<p>A good shot knows when he has missed; a
poor one does not know when he has hit.</p>

<h3>Too Small a Price</h3>

<p>Gunner:—“Would you believe that I shot
ninety-nine rabbits within two hours?”</p>

<p>Host:—“Why don’t you say one hundred at
once?”</p>

<p>Gunner:—“You don’t think I’d make a liar
of myself for just one rabbit?”</p>

<h3>Banter</h3>

<p>Lehman:—“Gentlemen, I must tell you a
pretty story of my friend Muller! Recently,
while out gunning, he shot at a rabbit, but, of
course, missed him. Now instead of running
away, the rabbit went up to friend Muller, bowed
and said quite distinctly: ‘Excuse me, sir, but
I wish to congratulate you. You shot at me
to-day for the twenty-fifth time, without hitting
me!’”</p>

<p>Muller:—“My friend Lehman’s story needs
a supplement. You must know that I introduced
myself to that rabbit. ‘What,’ cried the
rabbit, very pale, ‘your name is Muller! I
thought it was Lehman!’ and he is off like a
flash.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<h3>Cautious</h3>

<p>Förster:—“Sepp, the squire is coming to-day.
He is going to hunt.”</p>

<p>Sepp:—“Then I had better go at once and
lock up the dogs.”</p>

<p>Förster:—“Yes, and the calf too. The cow
you might leave in the field.”</p>

<p>Sepp:—“Don’t know about that.”</p>

<p>Förster:—“Well, lock her up too; better be
on the safe side.”</p>

<h3>Queer</h3>

<p>“Well this is killing! I shoot at a rabbit and
hit a snipe!”</p>

<h3>A Dog’s Intelligence</h3>

<p>A gunner tells the following story of a dog’s
astonishing cleverness. The dog received every
day from his master two pennies, to go to the
baker’s and get for himself some rolls to eat
for breakfast. The master watching him,
noticed that for several days, he came home
without his rolls. He followed him, and saw
him come from a butcher’s with a piece of
sausage. For five days the dog had saved his
pennies until he had enough to buy the piece
of sausage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<h3>Caught Him</h3>

<p>At a hunt a farmer saw a badger slip into a
hole, and at once he put his hand in to capture
the animal. A hunter who was present, asked
the farmer: “Have you caught him?” The
farmer, whose hand the badger was biting hard,
screamed: “No, but he has caught me!”</p>

<h3>Thoroughly Reformed</h3>

<p>Warden:—“Now, Killian, you are free once
more. I hope you will let this term in prison
be a warning to you, to curb your passion for
poaching. You are a family man, and you
ought to have more consideration for your poor
wife and young children.”</p>

<p>Killian (moved to tears):—“Oh yes, sir, I
see you mean well by me. You just wait and
see if I don’t bring to you the first deer I can
shoot!”</p>

<h3>He Remembered</h3>

<p>Gunner:—“Say, sonny, did you see a rabbit
running this way?”</p>

<p>Boy:—“I did, sir!”</p>

<p>Gunner:—“How long ago?”</p>

<p>Boy:—“’Bout three years ago last Christmas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<h3>Great Consolation</h3>

<p>Count A—— had lately returned from the
South of Asia. Several of his friends called on
him to invite him to a hunt. “Gentlemen,” he
said, languidly, “I am now so used to hunting
tigers, that a hunt without danger to life, has no
attractions for me.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said one of the hunters, drily,
“don’t let that worry you; I shot at my brother-in-law
yesterday, while we were out gunning!”</p>

<h3>Logic</h3>

<p>(Two farmers going through a field.) A:—“What
are you running all at once for? You
are not afraid of a rabbit?”</p>

<p>B:—“Rabbit! Who cares for a rabbit!
But where there is a rabbit, there is a gunner
not far off. I don’t care to have him blaze
away at me.”</p>

<h3>On a Bear Hunt</h3>

<p>An old Oberförster told the following yarn:—“You
can never imagine, gentlemen, the number
of bears there are in Russia, unless, like
myself, you have been there. Once a friend
and myself made an excursion from Petersburg
to the hunting-ground in Finland. We had not
been on the lookout very long, when my friend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
whispered: ‘There are two coming this way—you
can take the right one, I the left one.’ A
double shot, and both monsters were rolling on
the ground. At that instant several more bears
appeared. Bang—bang—bang—and they are
all stretched on the ground, in less than a
minute.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but how did you get time to load your
guns, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! In our excitement we never
thought of that!”</p>

<h3>A Very Remarkable Shot</h3>

<p>Herr von N. was a passionate lover of hunting,
and though he seldom hit anything, he
boasted the more. He was giving a large dinner-party,
and, as usual on such occasions, had his
man-servant standing behind his chair, so he
could appeal to him, as a witness of his heroic
deeds. “Now, gentlemen, I must tell you of a
very remarkable shot I made the other day.
I shot a very large deer through the right hind
leg and the right ear. What do you think of
that?” Everybody laughed.</p>

<p>“John, you were there,” cried Herr von N.,
“you can testify to it.”</p>

<p>“Most certainly,” replied the servant, “it is
all perfectly true. The deer—if the gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
will forgive my mentioning it—was scratching
his ear at the very moment my master hit it.”
The laughter grew to a roar. John stooped
over his master and whispered in his ear:
“When your Honor tells a story next, please
don’t have things so far apart or I might not be
able to put them together as well.”</p>

<h3>A Kind Neighbor</h3>

<p>“Will you permit me, friend, to shoot one of
the ducks in this pond? I’ll give you two
marks for it.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir!”</p>

<p>The gunner pays the money, kills the duck,
and, encouraged by his luck, asks the farmer if
he may have a second one, pays him two more
marks and kills another duck.</p>

<p>“Would you allow me to shoot a third one?”</p>

<p>“Sure, shoot all you want to; the ducks don’t
belong to me, but to my neighbor.”</p>

<h3>A Good Excuse</h3>

<p>Farmer (to another):—“I caught a rabbit
yesterday. He won’t get into my cabbage patch
again!”</p>

<p>Förster (coming up behind):—“So, that’s
right; and pray what did you do with that rabbit,
you rascal?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>Farmer:—“Well, well, what should I have
done with him! Look here, sir; I just took the
beast, belabored his fur well with my stick and
carried him into the next field. He won’t come
back here!”</p>

<p>Förster:—“Don’t doubt it at all!”</p>

<h3>Killed One</h3>

<p>Förster:—“Well, Doctor, what did you
shoot?”</p>

<p>Doctor:—“Oh, ah—I—killed one rabbit—and—wounded
three.”</p>

<h3>Age Limit</h3>

<p>City Swell:—“What a magnificent animal
a fully grown deer is! How old do they get?”</p>

<p>Gamekeeper:—“Well, you see, that depends
on—when they are shot!”</p>

<h3>Contradiction</h3>

<p>Förster (to gunner):—“What did you shoot
at?”</p>

<p>“At a doe, sir,—but I missed her!”</p>

<p>“What, you shot at a doe? Haven’t you
any eyes in your head? You ought to be
ashamed of yourself (furiously) to shoot at a
doe—and then to miss her besides!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<h3>Somewhat Uncertain</h3>

<p>Förster (to a gunner, who instead of rabbits,
has killed several dogs):—“Say, when you are
done with the dogs, tell us, so we can clear out
in time!”</p>

<h3>A Gentle Hint</h3>

<p>Teacher (to the Förster’s son):—“Are there
many rabbits in your father’s district?”</p>

<p>Pupil:—“Oh yes, sir, lots!”</p>

<p>Teacher:—“That’s queer; I never saw one.”</p>

<h3>A True Sunday Gunner</h3>

<p>A:—“Well, aren’t you coming yet?”</p>

<p>B:—“It takes that fellow a long time to get
his duds together!”</p>

<p>A:—“You haven’t forgotten anything?
You’ve got the ham, the sausage, the pheasant?”</p>

<p>C:—“Yes, I have them; I haven’t forgotten
a thing.”</p>

<p>A:—“Then let’s be off!”</p>

<p>C (Pulling his mustache):—“Good gracious!
I did forget something!”</p>

<p>A:—“What is it?”</p>

<p>C:—“I left my gun at home!”</p>

<h3>A Good Excuse</h3>

<p>Baron von Rothschild has made it a strict<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
rule that none of his guests are to take any of
the game shot on his preserves away with them.
Though he knew this, a gentleman wished to
take home to his wife, one of the pheasants he had
shot. He hung it up the chimney in his room,
and in the evening hid it in his bag. Early
the following morning Baron Rothschild came
into his guest’s room to take leave of him and
at the same time to see whether his friend was
going with his gunning bag empty. A setter
had followed the Baron into the room, and as he
smelled the bird at once, he hunted all over the
room until he finally pulled the finest pheasant
from the guest’s bag. “You see, Baron, knowing
that you send to market all the game that
is killed here for you, I retained this pheasant
to mark him and so be able to recognize him at
the market stall. Farewell!”</p>

<h3>Consolation</h3>

<p>A:—“I tell you, when I count what my
license costs, what my board comes to, while
on a gunning trip, what I ruin in clothes and
boots, what my neglect of business amounts to,
every rabbit I kill costs me about twenty
marks!”</p>

<p>B:—“Then you may thank your stars that
you hit so few.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<h3>Putting a Stop to Gunners’ Yarns</h3>

<p>Canon, the well-known painter, who died recently,
was an enthusiastic gunner. Often during
the gunning season he would join other
friends of the sport at the hotel, and experiences
would be exchanged. Now Canon hated all
extravagant, impossible yarns, and one evening
when some gunners tried to outdo each other,
his patience gave way. His strong voice rose
above the din, and everybody listened to the
following story: “My setter dog,” he began,
“has the finest sense of smell; a finer does not
exist. One day we were out partridge hunting,
but had no luck; after a three hours’ tramp not
a shot had been fired. Suddenly my dog stood
still, and then began scratching at the root of a
small bush. We approached cautiously. The
dog kept on digging, and after he had made
quite a hole, one of us went up and helped him.
All of a sudden he brought to me—a new
porcelain pipe with a partridge painted on it. I
always carry it with me as a souvenir.” He
put his hand in his pocket and laid the pipe on
the table. Shouts of laughter greeted it, but
there were no more gunning yarns after that.</p>

<i>For Doctors</i></h2>

</div>

<h3>Depends Upon Which He Strikes</h3>

<p>Professor:—“Gentlemen, I am going to
begin my lecture to-day, with the diseases
of mankind. When a person is ill, nature and
disease are fighting each other. The doctor
comes and beats about with a club, so to speak;
if he strikes the disease, the person will recover;
if he strikes nature, the patient dies.”</p>

<h3>At the Clinic</h3>

<p>“Yes, beloved hearers, every hour must find
us prepared to die. Death is inevitable, yes almost
sure!”</p>

<h3>Absent-Minded</h3>

<p>Professor:—“Gentlemen, I can inform you
that during the past month, more boys than
girls were born in our city; but as to the weddings
celebrated during the same period, the
number of women who were married exceeds
that of the men considerably.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<h3>Entered In</h3>

<p>“Gentlemen, at the last lecture we studied
the outer form and structure of the stomach;
to-day we will enter into the stomach itself.”</p>

<h3>At an Operation</h3>

<p>“Please, gentlemen, put your knives away
now, and take your fingers in your hand.”</p>

<h3>At the Hospital</h3>

<p>Professor:—“We have no patient here to-day
who needs an operation, but as his Highness,
our patron, wishes to attend one, we will try
one on this man here. He is a stranger in the
city, so it will be all right.”</p>

<h3>Consistency</h3>

<p>Doctor:—“Do you make experiments at
your hospital?”</p>

<p>Professor:—“I should say so! We have,
for instance, three divisions for inflammation of
the lungs. In the first, the patients are not
given anything; in the second, they are given
tartar-emetic; in the third, tartar-emetic and
they are also bled. In all three divisions deaths
are about even.”</p>

<p>Doctor:—“Don’t you think that many a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
patient of the first division could be saved, by
being bled?”</p>

<p>Professor:—“Don’t doubt it, but it can’t be
done. We must be firm, to reach the desired
result.”</p>

<h3>The Ruling Passion</h3>

<p>Miser:—“If, as you say, there is nothing
more to be done for me, I should like it better
if you could fix it so that I shall be dead
and buried by New Year.”</p>

<p>Doctor:—“What do you wish that for?”</p>

<p>Miser:—“Because I could save a lot of
money on New Year’s presents.”</p>

<h3>The Medicine Chest</h3>

<p>A ship’s doctor was in the habit of prescribing
sea-water for most ills. One day by an
unlucky accident, he fell overboard. “Hello,
Jack,” called one sailor to another, “the doctor
fell into his medicine chest!”</p>

<h3>Doctors Not Unlike Policemen</h3>

<p>The prince of R. once said to Hufeland:
“You are a famous physician. You know the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
human body so well inside and out, that you
ought to be able to cure all ills!”</p>

<p>“It is with doctors as with policemen,”
replied Hufeland. “We know the streets well,
but how the houses look on the inside, we can
only guess at.”</p>

<h3>Bound to Succeed</h3>

<p>“Say, surgeon,” thundered the Colonel,
“several more soldiers have died and you don’t
even seem to know the cause of so many
deaths!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall get at the mystery,” returned
the surgeon, “if it takes the whole regiment.”</p>

<h3>The Co-laborers</h3>

<p>Lady:—“Would you mind telling me, Doctor,
how it is that you have so many patients?”</p>

<p>Doctor:—“That is very simple. I have
three fine agents, who work for me and bring
me patients, without being paid for it; they
are Poverty, Intemperance, and Imagination.”</p>

<h3>No Need of a Doctor</h3>

<p>Doctor:—“While taking this cure, you must
diet yourself strictly; avoid all fatty and acid
foods; and leave beer and wine alone.”</p>

<p>Patient:—“Hold on, Doctor; if I must do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
without all that, I’ll get well without you. If
you can’t help me to be well, while I eat and
drink what I like, I have no use for either
yourself or your science!”</p>

<h3>Practice Makes Perfect</h3>

<p>Doctor:—“Well, you are coughing with less
exertion to-day!”</p>

<p>Patient:—“That’s not surprising, Doctor,
since I practiced at it all night.”</p>

<h3>A Dyeing Patient</h3>

<p>Doctor:—“My dear woman, your husband
is in the greatest danger! His hands and arms
are very red; he has scarlet fever in the worst
form!”</p>

<p>Wife:—“But, Doctor, my husband is a
dyer, and was using red this morning.”</p>

<p>Doctor:—“Oh well, then I can perhaps save
him yet!”</p>

<h3>Curiosity</h3>

<p>“You see, Doctor, whenever I shake my
head, my brain hurts dreadfully.”</p>

<p>“Why do you shake your head, then?”</p>

<p>“How else can I find out that my brain
hurts?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<h3>The Greater Risk</h3>

<p>Doctor:—“Well, Moses, what has happened?”</p>

<p>Moses:—“What has happened? My wife
drank coal-oil.”</p>

<p>Moses, Jr.:—“Father, mother is calling for
you constantly; do go in to her, so she will get
quiet!”</p>

<p>Moses:—“The Lord have mercy! I should
go to her? You go in first, Doctor.”</p>

<p>Doctor:—“Why shall I go in first?”</p>

<p>Moses:—“I have six children to support.”</p>

<p>Doctor:—“Well, and——?”</p>

<p>Moses:—“Well, and? you ask, Doctor, and
yet you are a smart man. What if she should
explode the moment I was with her?”</p>

<h3>Lung Trouble</h3>

<p>Countryman:—“Doctor, will you please prescribe
a little something for me. I think something
is wrong with my lung.”</p>

<p>Doctor (after examining him):—“You go
quietly home, my man; as long as you will
live, your lung will hold out all right.”</p>

<h3>How He Got Home</h3>

<p>Dr. Schneider was awakened at midnight by
a stranger who asked him to come to a patient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
at a little town two hours distant. “It is very
urgent,” added the messenger. The Doctor
had his team brought around, and drove away
with the stranger. Arrived at the town, the
man jumped from the buggy, saying: “I am
very much obliged to you, Doctor. I was dead
tired and did not know how to get home, so I
thought of you and your team. Now I shall be
at home in a few minutes. I hope you will get
home all right.”</p>

<h3>Out of Joint</h3>

<p>Augusta:—“Well, Ricke, I tell you it is
dreadful to be a servant in a Doctor’s family?
Just think, every morning his bones are scattered
all over the room!”</p>

<p>Ricke:—“Good gracious! Does the man
take himself apart every evening?”</p>

<h3>Patience</h3>

<p>Minister (at a sick bed):—“Just have patience,
my good woman; all will be well.”</p>

<p>Old country woman:—“It’s easy to talk, sir,
but I should just like to know what I have
done. Lots of people die so easy, and it’s killing
me!”</p>

<h3>Death Loves a Shining Mark</h3>

<p>“Rebecca,” said Reb Baruch, who was dangerously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
ill, to his wife, “get your most beautiful
gown and dress yourself as for a wedding!”</p>

<p>“Why? What for? What good would it
do you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. If the angel of death should
enter, and see you standing there, looking so
beautiful, he might like you better, and take
you instead of me!”</p>

<h3>Rheumatism or Gout</h3>

<p>A physician who was asked the difference
between rheumatism and gout, answered: “If
you take a vise, put a finger between, and turn
until you can’t stand it any longer, that’s
rheumatism; if you turn once more, that’s
gout.”</p>

<h3>Humor on the Deathbed</h3>

<p>When Frank, a famous Vienna physician was
dying, eight of his colleagues sat around his
bed, in consultation. All at once the dying
man laughed aloud and said: “I was just
thinking of that French grenadier, who, at the
battle of Wagram, fell after being struck by
eight bullets, and whose last words were:
Sapristi, it takes eight bullets to kill a French
grenadier!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<h3>Very Ill</h3>

<p>A hospital physician asked a sick old man,
how he was.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Doctor,” said the good old fellow,
“I feel so ill, that if some one told me I was
dead, I should not be surprised.”</p>

<h3>Poor Schleiermacher</h3>

<p>The famous preacher Schleiermacher had,
during a severe illness, been under the care
of the celebrated Dr. Gräfe. After his recovery,
Schleiermacher wrote to him and enclosed
in his letter four Friedrichsd’or—about
thirty-one dollars. Gräfe sent the amount back
with this rude answer: “Wealthy people pay
me what they like; the well-to-do pay the
regular fee; the poor pay nothing.” Whereupon
Schleiermacher wrote: “Sir! For the
return of the four Friedrichsd’or accept poor
Schleiermacher’s sincere thanks!”</p>

<h3>Who Was Right</h3>

<p>The celebrated Dr. Heim, who was known
to be often slightly intoxicated, was called while
in that condition, into a family whose regular
physician he was.</p>

<p>The gentleman of the house, who was taken
with an attack of acute indigestion, and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
suffering intense pain, confessed that it might
be the result of having eaten too many raw
oysters. “Give him Chester cheese, and a
good big portion of it,” said Heim, and without
another word, walked out.</p>

<p>The patient’s family, who imagined that
cheese was more indigestible than oysters, shook
their heads over their doctor’s advice, and
thinking that in his intoxicated condition he
had made a big mistake, gave him rum instead
of the cheese. A few hours later the patient
died.</p>

<p>The next morning Heim came to look after
his patient. He was told that he had died in
the night.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you give him the Chester cheese?”
asked Heim.</p>

<p>“No, Doctor,—we thought—you were—we
gave him rum.”</p>

<p>“So,” Heim cried furiously: “you thought,
because I was drunk, you knew more of medicine
than I, and in that mad idea killed your
patient. But I want you to know, that even if
I am drunk, I still know more of medicine, than
you do in all your sobriety. Now you send for
two dozen oysters at once, and I’ll prove to you
that even if I do drink a glass of wine, I know
very well what I am talking about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>The oysters were brought, and at Heim’s order,
were divided and placed into two separate
dishes. To those in one dish he put several
slices of Chester cheese; to the others he poured
several glasses of rum. “Now, then,” he said,
“you let that stuff stand for a few hours and
we’ll see who knew best!”</p>

<p>Growling and scolding—for Heim was as
famous for his roughness as for his skill—he
went away. When he returned a few hours
later and the dishes were uncovered, it was found
that the oysters mixed with cheese had dissolved
into a foam-like substance, while those soaked
in rum were in an unchanged condition.</p>

<p>“Well, who was right?” asked Heim. The
unhappy relatives were forced to look upon
themselves as the murderers of their beloved
dead.</p>

<h3>A New Cure for Headache</h3>

<p>A lady patient, who often suffered from severe
headaches, once asked Heim’s pardon for trying
a remedy which was said to be an infallible
cure. She had been told when next the pain
came on, to cover her head with cabbage.
“Very good thing,” said Heim, “but don’t
forget to put a sausage on top of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<h3>Strange Effects of Alcohol</h3>

<p>One evening Heim was called into a family
where the infant daughter had been suddenly
taken with spasms. Heim felt the baby’s pulse,
shook his head, felt his own pulse, then the
infant’s again, and at last said: “The baby is
drunk; her pulse is exactly the same as mine.”
That seemed a queer diagnosis, but it was soon
evident that old Heim was right as usual.
There had been a celebration in the family that
day, and the wet nurse had made use of the
occasion to drink a bottle of wine on the sly.</p>

<h3>Good for Asses</h3>

<p>A lady of the aristocracy bothered old Heim
dreadfully with questions as to what she could
feed her baby on, to make it grow fat. One
day she followed him to the house door. “One
thing more, dear Doctor! What is asses’ milk
good for?”</p>

<p>“For young asses,” replied Heim, and walked
off.</p>

<h3>Wanted a Return for Her Money</h3>

<p>Cook:—“Good Frau, since there are two
holy days coming, I am going to the hospital.”</p>

<p>Mistress:—“Why, Marie! are you ill?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>Cook:—“No, thank God; there is nothing
the matter with me, but I have paid my sick
benefit regularly for six years, and I should like
to get something out of it.”</p>

<h3>His Reward</h3>

<p>“You are an awfully good-natured fellow, to
give your man his medicine, yourself. Not
many masters would do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, the medicine tastes so horrid,
that it is great fun to see the faces he makes,
as I pour it down his throat.”</p>

<h3>Better Than Half a Nose</h3>

<p>While operating upon an old man, Professor
Billroth, of Vienna, told the physicians and students
present the following amusing story:
“Some time ago an old man came to me to
consult me about the disease of his nose. He
owned only half a one, and that was not worth
much, so he thought I could operate upon it
and give him a decent artificial one. I asked
how old he was. ‘I am eighty years old,’ he
said.</p>

<p>“‘Do you think it necessary at that age to undergo
an operation?’ I asked of my patient.</p>

<p>“‘Professor,’ says the old fellow, ‘my father
lived to be one hundred and twenty-five years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
old, and I don’t see why I should walk around
for forty-five years with only half a nose.’”</p>

<h3>Kill or Cure</h3>

<p>The wife of a farmer in Westphalia was seriously
ill, and the doctor was sent for.</p>

<p>“I have a hundred thalers in this bag here,
doctor,” said the well-to-do farmer, “and
whether you kill her or cure her, you shall have
the money.” The patient died. A few months
later, the doctor came to get the promised
money.</p>

<p>“I am ready to keep my promise,” said the
farmer, “but first you will answer me two questions:
did you kill my wife?”</p>

<p>“God forbid!” said the doctor. “I certainly
could not say yes, to that!”</p>

<p>“So much the better. Well, then, did you
cure her?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then I am sorry I can’t give you the money.
If you wish to bring suit for it—I can’t prevent
you.”</p>

<p>The doctor took good care not to go to law
about it.</p>

<h3>Dr. Schweninger as a Statue</h3>

<p>A porter once took a friend from the country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
to show him around Munich, and among other
places of interest they went to the University.
The countryman wanted to know what the
figures on the front of the building meant. The
porter, to hide his ignorance, mentioned several
great men of the time. Arrived at a scantily
clad Greek philosopher, he says unblushingly:
“That is Dr. Schweninger!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bismarck’s family doctor! But why
hasn’t he a coat on?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, Seppel, since he cured the
Chancellor, the people just fight over him, so it
is no wonder he hasn’t a coat left.”</p>

<h3>An Uncertain Bargain</h3>

<p>At the clinic of the University of Kiel, appeared
some time ago, a stalwart countryman
about forty years of age, who asked Professor
N. to buy his skeleton. “But, my good man,”
said he, looking him all over, “I am afraid we
should have to wait a long time to come into
possession of our own. What do you want the
money for?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I wanted to emigrate to Australia
with it,” replied the countryman.</p>

<h3>Natural Death</h3>

<p>A traveler asked the host of a country tavern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
why, being ill, he did not send for a physician?</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the sick man, “the people
of this village don’t think anything of doctors;
we all like to die a natural death.”</p>

<h3>“Got You at Last”</h3>

<p>A physician from Baden-Baden tells this
story: “It was a clear cold night—after twelve
o’clock. I was returning from a visit in the
country, and riding through the forests I heard
the sounds of ax-strokes. There was no doubt
about what this meant. I was in good humor,
so I tied my horse to a tree, sneaked up close to
the thieves, and watched their doings for a
while. As they were giving the last strokes
which were to bring down a beautiful tree, I
jumped from behind my hiding-place, crying:
‘Got you at last, you villains!’</p>

<p>“‘Clear out—it’s the forester!’ called a
voice; and as quick as lightning the whole
company disappeared. One ax was left behind,
and I took it as a trophy and rode home. The
whole affair passed so quickly that I could not
see distinctly any one of the trespassers.</p>

<p>“Years passed, when one afternoon as I entered
a tavern in Baden-Baden, my attention
was drawn to a party playing cards. The game<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
seemed to be lost to the man whose back was
turned to me. Suddenly he cried out: ‘Mine
with the bower, and thank you!’ It was the
same voice, that years ago, had given the command:
‘Clear out!’</p>

<p>“A second game began. I stood behind my
man looking at his cards. As he took up a
long-expected trump I called to him unexpectedly:
‘Got you at last, you villain!’ Slowly
the player turned around to me and said:
‘Where is my ax?’”</p>

<h3>Drinks What is Good</h3>

<p>Druggist (to a countryman):—“I can’t recommend
anything better than Dr. Muller’s health-tea.
That is good, and is sure to help you.”</p>

<p>Countryman:—“Oh, if Dr. Muller makes
it, let’s have it. Dr. Muller doesn’t drink anything
bad.”</p>

<h3>Precaution</h3>

<p>A patient is about to take gas to have a tooth
pulled. While the dentist is making his preparations,
the man counts his money. “Oh, leave
that until afterwards,” says the dentist, thinking
his patient wants to pay him in advance.</p>

<p>“Why afterwards,” cried he, “if you are going
to take my senses away, I want to know beforehand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
how much money I have in my pocketbook!”</p>

<h3>Reciprocity</h3>

<p>A well-known and popular actor came to a
dentist to have a tooth pulled. When the operation
was over he took out his purse. The dentist
seeing this, said: “You have given me pleasure
so often, that I am pleased to be able to return
the favor, so never mind the pay!”</p>

<h3>Secrets of Medical Science</h3>

<p>Among the effects of the famous Dr. Boerhave,
was a well wrapped and sealed package,
with this inscription: “The only and deepest
secrets of medical science.” When his library
was sold this package brought 20,000 marks.
On breaking the seals, the purchaser found nothing
but a few empty leaves, on the first one of
which was written in large letters, Keep your
head cool, your bowels open, your feet warm,
and you can laugh at all doctors.</p>

<h3>A Pointed Answer</h3>

<p>Dr. M. whose bruskness was well known
throughout Silesia, was going by coach one day
from Breslau to Liegnitz. In the waiting-room
were several gentlemen waiting for the same
coach. One of them came up to the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>“Are you Dr. M.?” he asked.</p>

<p>“At your service,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it. Since you know
everything, you could possibly answer a question.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so; let me hear what it is.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see my mustache is already gray,
while the hair on my head is still black; what is
the cause of it?”</p>

<p>Without a moment’s reflection the doctor replied:
“The cause is simply this, that you have
always used your mouth more than your head.”</p>

<h3>How He Took the Pills</h3>

<p>Doctor:—“Why, the boy is perfectly well
again. I knew my pills would cure him. How
did you take them, son? In sugar water?”</p>

<p>Boy:—“No, sir; in the popgun. I shot sparrows
with them.”</p>

<h3>Had Them in His Head</h3>

<p>“Can you name the bones of the skull?”
asked a professor of a student.</p>

<p>“I have them all in my head,” was the answer,
“but I can’t think of the names just now.”</p>

<h3>Too Much Mustard</h3>

<p>Doctor (to an emaciated patient):—“Now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
you want one mustard plaster on your chest and
one on your back.”</p>

<p>Patient:—“Isn’t that rather too much mustard
for so little meat, doctor?”</p>

<i>For Lawyers</i></h2>

</div>

<h3>Fame and Wealth</h3>

<p>The lawyer becomes famous through his
cleverness, popular through his astuteness, but
fat and wealthy through the foolishness of his
fellow-men.</p>

<h3>Rewarded Industry</h3>

<p>“It is terrible how slow Secretary Meier
works!” exclaimed the President; “there he is
behind again with a big stack of papers! What
shall we do with them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there is Muller, a prompt, industrious
clerk, he is never behind! Let’s give them to
him,” said the Director.</p>

<h3>Secret and Public</h3>

<p>“What is the difference between a secret and
a public session of the town council?”</p>

<p>“When there is a secret session, one knows
the result an hour later; the result of a public
session, one reads in next day’s paper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<h3>Evidence of Dishonesty</h3>

<p>Detective:—“Your suspicion of your cashier
has not been confirmed; you may be sure of his
honesty. He makes no show whatever, lives, to
be sure, decently...!”</p>

<p>Director (interrupting him):—“Yes, but ...
that’s just it; with the salary I give him, it’s impossible
to live decently!”</p>

<h3>Of Course</h3>

<p>Judge (to accused’s wife):—“Were you with
your husband when he broke into the young ladies’
boarding-school?”</p>

<p>Wife:—“Of course; would <i>your</i> wife permit
you to break into a young ladies’ school by yourself?”</p>

<h3>An Honest Lawyer</h3>

<p>“But, Doctor, I must win that lawsuit; the
contract is as clear as daylight!”</p>

<p>“So it is—but let me tell you, when it comes
to a lawsuit, clearness is a thing of the past.”</p>

<h3>Out of Business</h3>

<p>“What, are you back from Africa already?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I had settled there as sheriff, but there
was nothing to levy upon but now and then a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
nose-ring ... and then I generally had a suit
brought against me for levying on an indispensable
article of dress.”</p>

<h3>Short Work</h3>

<p>“What,” said the disgusted lawyer to a countryman,
“didn’t I have you thrown out just
now because you were too fresh, and here you
are back again!”</p>

<p>“Doctor,” returns he, “please be good, and
undertake my defense; I see you are the only
lawyer who makes short work!”</p>

<h3>Question and Answer</h3>

<p>Lady (at a lawyer’s who is a friend):—“A
question does not cost anything?”</p>

<p>Lawyer:—“No, but the answer does.”</p>

<h3>At Examination</h3>

<p>Professor:—“Candidate, what belongs to a
last will and testament?”</p>

<p>Candidate:—“A death and a fortune.”</p>

<h3>Suggestive Question</h3>

<p>Professor:—“Candidate, what in law do we
call one who assists another in committing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
crime—who for instance, makes him a key, with
which to open the door?”</p>

<p>Candidate:—“That is a locksmith.”</p>

<h3>Final Farewell</h3>

<p>Professor:—“Candidate, what does the term
<i>dos</i> mean?”</p>

<p>Candidate:—“<i>Dos</i>—<i>dos</i>—I am sorry I can’t
think of it this minute.”</p>

<p>Professor:—“Imagine you were engaged to
be married. On your wedding day your father-in-law
says, ‘I shall give my daughter 50,000
thaler.’ What would that be?”</p>

<p>Candidate:—“That would be great good
luck for me.”</p>

<p>Professor:—“I fully agree with you. Now
translate for me this mandate from the Codex.
Read the introduction.”</p>

<p>Candidate (reads):—“<i>Sancimus hac lege in
perpetuum valitura</i>——”</p>

<p>Professor:—“Stop! Translate these words.”</p>

<p>Candidate (translates):—“Read this—and
then farewell forever!”</p>

<p>Professor:—“Good, very good! I also will
say to you: Farewell forever!”</p>

<h3>Saving in Vain</h3>

<p>Professor:—“Well, candidate, which seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
to you the better, that the present generation
should save for the future generation, or that
they should leave debts behind?”</p>

<p>Candidate:—“I believe it would be better to
leave debts behind.”</p>

<p>Professor:—“Why; what are your reasons?”</p>

<p>Candidate:—“We can’t be expected to save
for a generation, of which we do not even know
whether it will exist. If the judgment day
should come unexpectedly, we would have saved
for nothing.”</p>

<h3>No Criminal</h3>

<p>Professor:—“What is a crime?”</p>

<p>Candidate (stuttering):—“A crime is—is,
when some one—does—something!”</p>

<p>Professor (laughing):—“Then candidate,
you are certainly no criminal.”</p>

<h3>A Modern Solomon</h3>

<p>Professor:—“I will put a law case before
you: Mother and daughter slept with their
two little boys, in the same room. As the
children were dressed exactly alike, the nurses
changed them, so nobody could tell which was
the mother’s and which the daughter’s child.
How would you decide the case?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>Candidate:—“Are you sure that the children
were exchanged?”</p>

<p>Professor:—“Didn’t I tell you so just now?”</p>

<p>Candidate:—“Very well, then you simply
exchange the children again.”</p>

<h3>Direct or Indirect</h3>

<p>“Is the dog tax a direct or an indirect tax?”</p>

<p>“An indirect one.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because it is not collected directly from the
dog.”</p>

<h3>Mortgages</h3>

<p>“Candidate, what do you know about mortgages?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all; so far, I have always been
able to borrow without one.”</p>

<h3>Her Age</h3>

<p>“You are thirty years old?” asked a magistrate
of a lady whose deposition he was taking
down.</p>

<p>“No, twenty,” she answered.</p>

<p>“But I was born in the same year you were.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said the lady, snappishly, “you
probably lived faster than I!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<h3>It Makes a Difference</h3>

<p>“What is the matter with this woman?”</p>

<p>“She fell on the slippery sidewalk, because
there was no sand put on it.”</p>

<p>“Where was it? I’ll put the landlord’s
name down at once!”</p>

<p>“It was before the town hall, policeman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, before the town hall! you should have
been more careful, my good woman!”</p>

<h3>Don’t Go</h3>

<p>Professor (complaining):—“For the past two
weeks a student has occupied the room below
mine. The impudent fellow plays the piano
and sings every blessed night, ‘Come down,
oh Madonna Theresa!’ What can I do about
it?”</p>

<p>Police Sergeant:—“Is your name Theresa?”</p>

<p>Professor:—“No.”</p>

<p>Police Sergeant:—“Well then you need not
take any notice of it.”</p>

<h3>An Acquired Interest</h3>

<p>“How did you manage to have your attorney
take such an interest in your lawsuit?”</p>

<p>“I borrowed a hundred dollars from him.
If I lose my lawsuit he will lose his money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<h3>Fatal</h3>

<p>Judge:—“Well, Doctor, what do you think
of your patient’s wounds?”</p>

<p>Doctor:—“Two of them are fatal, without a
doubt; but if the patient is kept quiet, it is
probable that the third one will be healed in a
couple of months.”</p>

<h3>A Great Temptation</h3>

<p>“How did you break into that house?”</p>

<p>“Your Honor, it was two o’clock in the
morning; no night watchman in sight; an
open window in front of me—why, you yourself
would have gone in!”</p>

<h3>Misplaced Pathos</h3>

<p>“Gentlemen of the Jury! When the pear is
ripe, it falls from the tree! This pear (pointing
towards the accused) grew ripe, fell from the
tree, and here it sits—in the dock!”</p>

<h3>Before the Court</h3>

<p>Judge:—“So the accused stole a <i>salam</i>,
(choice sausage)—where is it?”</p>

<p>Constable:—“Here, your Honor, is the <i>corpus
delicati</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<h3>Curious to Hear</h3>

<p>Judge:—“You wish your trial postponed,
prisoner, because your counsel has been taken
ill; but since you were caught red-handed and
have confessed the theft, I don’t see what your
counsel could say in your favor.”</p>

<p>Prisoner:—“That’s just what I am curious
to hear, your Honor!”</p>

<h3>Among Ourselves</h3>

<p>Presiding Judge (addressing the crowd in the
courtroom):—“I warn you that if there are
any more disturbances, I’ll have the court
cleared!”</p>

<p>Prisoner:—“That’ll be much better, your
Honor; then we’ll be among ourselves!”</p>

<h3>Wished to Confess</h3>

<p>“If it pleases the court,” said a prisoner,
who so far had stoutly denied his guilt, during
the poor defense his counsel made, “make him
shut up; I’d rather confess.”</p>

<h3>A Fatal Cold</h3>

<p>Governor (to a prisoner while inspecting the
penitentiary):—“What brought you here?”</p>

<p>Prisoner:—“My cold.”</p>

<p>Governor:—“What? Your cold?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>Prisoner:—“Yes, sir; I had a bad cold
when I broke into that house, and had to
sneeze; it awoke the gentleman; he caught me,
and so I was brought here.”</p>

<h3>Doing the Honors</h3>

<p>Warden (to the prisoners):—“His Honor is
going to visit the jail this afternoon! Prepare
yourselves for it!”</p>

<p>Rogue (to a fellow prisoner):—“Hans, you
do the honors!”</p>

<h3>Needed His Tools</h3>

<p>Warden:—“Here is the money that is due
you. I hope you will now find an honorable
way of making a living.”</p>

<p>Prisoner:—“Certainly, sir, you may depend
on it.”</p>

<p>Warden:—“Well, we shall see; you may go
now! Why are you hesitating? Do you wish
to say anything?”</p>

<p>Prisoner (whose burglar kit had been taken
from him when he was arrested):—“Might
I ask your Honor for my tools?”</p>

<h3>Malicious</h3>

<p>Attorney (to the manager of a theatre on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
seeing the empty house):—“Why, my dear
sir, is the public excluded to-day?”</p>

<h3>Taken Aback</h3>

<p>Attorney:—“I assure you, charming Fräulein,
we lawyers advance very slowly. One is always
waiting for the other’s death. Look, for
instance, at that old judge over there. From
year to year we have been waiting for the old
codger to go off and make room for——”</p>

<p>Lady (interrupting him):—“Sir, that gentleman—is
my father!”</p>

<h3>Force of Habit</h3>

<p>A lawyer was speaking at the grave of a colleague.
No eye had remained dry, until, putting
down a wreath, the orator closed with
great pathos, saying: “Rest in peace, dear
friend ... and you, gentlemen of the jury,
preserve ever a pleasant memory of the
accused!”</p>

<h3>At the Mercy of the Court</h3>

<p>Waiter:—“What do you wish me to order
for your dinner, sir?”</p>

<p>Attorney (pointing to the kitchen):—“I
leave that to the mercy of the court!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<h3>His First Attempt</h3>

<p>“To-morrow I am going to hand my first attempt
at a drama to the manager of our
theatre.”</p>

<p>“Friend, as a lawyer, you ought to know
that even an attempt at crime is punishable.”</p>

<h3>Difference of Statement</h3>

<p>“Is it true that you said the man Meier
here, had stolen your pocketbook?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that, Squire; I only stated,
that if Meier had not helped me to look for it, I
should have found it again.”</p>

<h3>On Time</h3>

<p>Clerk of the Court (to countryman):—“What
do you want here so early? There is nobody
here yet, but myself! Before eight o’clock
no business is accepted. Don’t you see that it
is still two whole minutes of eight? In two
minutes you will find me in!”</p>

<h3>Doubtful Presents</h3>

<p>Rogue:—“Doctor, you got me free. I must
show my gratitude. Take this watch.”</p>

<p>Counsel:—“No, no; you are a poor devil.
Where did you get the watch?”</p>

<p>Rogue:—“Why, it’s the one I stole.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<h3>Unstable Evidence</h3>

<p>Detective (looking for evidence at the spot
where a murder had been committed):—“The
footprint in this anthill is of the utmost importance.
It might—most probably it will—lead to
the discovery of the murderer. Constable,
hurry back to town at once, bring a bag and a
shovel, and shovel this highly important footprint
into it. We will take it back with us!”</p>

<h3>Willing to Show Him</h3>

<p>Judge:—“It is utterly incomprehensible to
me how you could kill the man with one blow
of your bare fist!”</p>

<p>Accused:—“Shall I show you how I did
it?”</p>

<h3>He Understood</h3>

<p>Magistrate:—“You complain that your
neighbor struck you during a quarrel?”</p>

<p>Washerwoman:—“Yes, your Honor, he
struck me several times with his cane on—on—”</p>

<p>Magistrate:—“Never mind; sit down on
the missing word.”</p>

<h3>Importance of Being Precise</h3>

<p>Squire:—“You are a carpenter, are you
not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You were working near the place where the
row occurred?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“How far away were you?”</p>

<p>“Thirty-six and a half feet.”</p>

<p>“How can you tell so exact?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I measured it. I thought right
away, some fool from court would ask me about
it.”</p>

<h3>Objected to Income Tax</h3>

<p>Magistrate:—“You are accused of loafing;
why don’t you work?”</p>

<p>Loafer:—“Because then I would have to pay
an income tax.”</p>

<h3>A Witness Against His Will</h3>

<p>Judge:—“Constable, bring in the next witness!”
(Constable beckons to a man by the
door to step up.)</p>

<p>Judge:—“What is your name?”</p>

<p>Peter:—“Peter Lerch.”</p>

<p>Judge:—“How old are you?”</p>

<p>Peter:—“I don’t think that’s necessary to
tell.”</p>

<p>Judge (severely):—“Will you tell me at
once, how old you are?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>Peter:—“Thirty-three years.”</p>

<p>Judge:—“Are you a Lutheran or a Catholic?”</p>

<p>Peter:—“But, your Honor——”</p>

<p>Judge (interrupting him):—“If you dare to
interrupt me again——”</p>

<p>Peter (quickly):—“I’m a Lutheran.”</p>

<p>Judge:—“Are you related to the accused or
in their service?”</p>

<p>Peter (indignant):—“I? to those? Rather
not! What is your Honor thinking of?”
(Laughter in the courtroom.)</p>

<p>Judge:—“Refrain from all improper remarks!
Raise your hand and take the oath.”</p>

<p>Peter:—“Oh, but really your Honor, that’s
too much.”</p>

<p>Judge (rises and cries furiously):—“I’ll have
you arrested, if you dare to contradict again.
Raise your hand and repeat the oath after me.”
(Peter does it meekly.)</p>

<p>Judge:—“And now what have you to say?”</p>

<p>Peter:—“The Colonel sends his regards, and
asks you to come to dinner to-night at eight
o’clock. The deer he shot yesterday has arrived.”</p>

<p>Judge:—“What on earth—— Aren’t you
a witness?”</p>

<p>Peter:—“No, your Honor; I’m the Colonel’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
orderly. Not finding you at home I came
here; and when I asked for you, the Constable
showed me in here.”</p>

<h3>A Pointed Suggestion</h3>

<p>A celebrated lawyer was pleading a case before
a famous judge, and made such daring assertions
that he roused the latter into saying:
“Well, if this is law, I’m going home to burn
all my books.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” replied the lawyer quietly,
“it would be better if your Honor went home
to read them.”</p>

<h3>On His Side</h3>

<p>A lawyer once asked a minister, “If the
clergy and the devil had a lawsuit together,
who would win?”</p>

<p>“The devil,” was the quick answer, “for he
has all the lawyers on his side.”</p>

<h3>A Legal Tilt</h3>

<p>Two lawyers, one as tall as a giant, the other
as small as a dwarf, were getting so excited over
a case on hand, that the giant said to the other:
“Who are you? Why, I could put you in my
pocket.”</p>

<p>The other replied quietly: “Then there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
would be more law in your pocket than there is
in your head.”</p>

<h3>Finally</h3>

<p>Counsel (closing his speech):—“And finally,
gentlemen of the jury, I would have you remember
the golden rule: ‘Do unto others, as you
wish others to do unto you,’ or would you like
to lie in a prison cell, for years?”</p>

<h3>Mozart’s Affection</h3>

<p>Mozart loved his parents tenderly. When
quite a little fellow, he composed a song, which
he sang with his father every night before going
to bed, while standing on a chair where his father
had to put him. This ceremony over, he would
kiss them and retire in peace and contentment.
This nightly performance he kept up until he
reached his tenth year.</p>

<h3>Mozart Before the Emperor</h3>

<p>When Mozart was six years old, his father
took him to the palace, to play before Emperor
Francis I. Taking him to the piano the Emperor
started to turn the leaves for him, when the boy
said: “No, you let Wagenseil (the leader of
the orchestra) do that, he knows how.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<h3>A Rapid Composer</h3>

<p>The evening before the first performance of
“Don Juan” at Prag, Mozart told his wife that
he intended to write the overture during the
night, and asked her to make a punch
for him and stay with him, to keep him awake.
But exertion and sleepiness made the work so
hard, that his wife begged him to rest on the
sofa, promising to waken him in an hour. He
slept so soundly that she let him sleep two hours.
It was five o’clock when she wakened him. At
seven the copyist was to come. Mozart worked
now so rapidly, that in two hours the overture
was finished.</p>

<h3>Criticised the Emperor</h3>

<p>One day Mozart and his wife were walking in
the Augarten near Vienna. His wife was telling
him about her dog’s devotion, and said: “You
just pretend to strike me and see how he will
jump at you!” Just as Mozart playfully struck
his wife on the shoulder, the Emperor stepped
from his summer-house.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said he; “just three weeks
married, and fighting already!”</p>

<p>Mozart explained, and the Emperor laughing,
asked:</p>

<p>“Do you remember the anecdote of Wagenseil?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
and how, when I played the violin,
you called from among my audience, sometimes
‘Pshaw! that was wrong!’ sometimes,
‘bravo!’”</p>

<h3>Mozart’s Generosity</h3>

<p>Mozart was very generous. An old and
honest piano repairer had put some new strings
on his beloved instrument.</p>

<p>“What do I owe you, old friend?” asked
Mozart. “I am going away to-morrow and
wish to pay you now!”</p>

<p>The old man, who always grew dreadfully
embarrassed if any one spoke to him, stammered:</p>

<p>“To be sure—your Honor—I have been
here—several—times I beg—a thaler.”</p>

<p>“What, a man like you, come to me for one
thaler?” With that he put several ducats
into the old man’s hand and fled.</p>

<h3>George Friedrich Händel</h3>

<p>For a number of years after Händel settled in
London he was financially very unlucky. His
operas did not take, and when his friends complained
that the house was so empty, he would
comfort them by saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>“That does not matter at all, the music will
sound so much the better!”</p>

<h3>Reading at Sight</h3>

<p>On a trip to Ireland, Händel was detained
for a few days at Chester. As he wished to try
some of the choruses that he intended to bring
out in Ireland, he asked the organist of the Cathedral,
Backer, whether he had any singers in his
choir who could sing by sight. Backer named
some of his best singers, among them a printer,
Janson, who sang bass very well. Händel appointed
the time for a private rehearsal at his
hotel; but poor Janson, after repeated trials,
made so many mistakes in the chorus of The
Messiah, “And through his wounds” that
Händel grew furious and after swearing at him
in four or five languages, cried in broken English:
“You villain, you, didn’t you say you
could read by sight?”</p>

<p>“So I can, sir,” replied Janson, “only not
the very first time!”</p>

<h3>About as Well as the Cook</h3>

<p>When Gluck came to England the first time,
in 1745, Händel was asked what he thought of
him. His answer, preceded by an oath was:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>“He knows and understands counterpoint about
as well as my cook!”</p>

<h3>Home Again</h3>

<p>One evening while Händel was at Dublin, a
certain Mr. Dubourg was to sing a solo to an
aria, with a cadence <i>ad libitum</i>. For some time
he strayed about in different keys, but at last he
commenced the trill with which the cadence
closed and Händel cried loud enough for the
whole house to hear, to the great amusement of
the audience: “Welcome home, Mr. Dubourg!”</p>

<h3>Too Particular</h3>

<p>In 1749, Händel had such poor success with
his oratorio “Theodora” that he was pleased
when some musicians, who did not play in it,
accepted tickets. Later on some of these gentlemen
begged permission to hear The Messiah,
but Händel said: “Oh, I am your humble servant,
gentlemen; you are too infernally particular!
You did not care to hear Theodora,
when there was room enough to dance, now
there is none left for you!”</p>

<h3>The Villain</h3>

<p>Händel was holding the last rehearsal of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
incomparable and difficult “Te Deum Laudamus”
to be rendered at the celebration of the
Peace of Utrecht. Before starting, he cried, full
of enthusiasm: “Gentlemen! Whoever makes
a mistake to-day, is a villain!”</p>

<p>The sublime composition, the excellent rendition,
carried him away to such an extent, that
at the end of a phrase, forgetting everything
around him, he stood like one inspired, and when
spoken to, shivered and was unable to control
his emotion. With the last note, he cried, tears
streaming down his face: “Gentlemen, I am
the villain!”</p>

<h3>F. Joseph Haydn</h3>

<p>While Haydn lived in Ungarn (Hungary)
gunning and fishing were his favorite recreations.
He never forgot that he once killed three pheasants
at one shot, which afterwards graced the
dinner table of the Empress, Maria Theresa.</p>

<h3>Haydn’s Strategy</h3>

<p>In 1770, Haydn was very ill with a malignant
fever, and during his convalescence his physician
strictly forbade his doing any work or touching
the piano. Soon after, Haydn’s wife went to
church, but before going impressed on the maid
the necessity of watching her master closely so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
that he could not get at the piano. Haydn pretended
not to have heard a word of this order,
but his wife had hardly left the house, when he
sent the maid on an errand. He hurried to the
piano, and at the first touch the whole idea of a
sonata came to him. The first part was finished
while his wife was at church. When he heard
her returning, he quickly went back to bed and
finished it there.</p>

<h3>These Brought Contentment</h3>

<p>Haydn owned a case filled with snuff-boxes,
watches, rings, medals, and other presents from
all the crowned heads of Austria, Russia, Prussia,
Spain, France, and Naples. He said: “When
life seems sometimes hard to bear, I look at all
these things, and feel content and pleased to
have been honored by all Europe.”</p>

<h3>Haydn and the Ship-Captain</h3>

<p>One day a ship-captain came to Haydn’s room.
“Are you Haydn?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; what can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you thirty guineas if you compose
a march for my ship’s band; but it must be
done to-day, for to-morrow morning we set sail
for Calcutta.”</p>

<p>Haydn promised to have it ready early the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
following morning; went to the piano as soon
as the captain had left him, and was soon done
with it. It seemed to the composer that he had
earned his money too easily, so during the evening
he composed two more marches, to give the
captain his choice or make him a present of the
other two. It was barely daylight when the
captain appeared.</p>

<p>“Captain, the march is finished.”</p>

<p>“Very good, play it for me!”</p>

<p>Haydn played.</p>

<p>The Englishman put the thirty guineas on the
piano, and without saying another word took
up his march and walked to the door. Haydn
followed him saying: “I composed two more,
which I think are better. Let me play them for
you and take your choice.”</p>

<p>“The first march pleases me, so that ends
it!”</p>

<p>“But listen to the others, perhaps——”</p>

<p>“No, that is impossible!”</p>

<p>The captain hurried down the stairs, Haydn
ran after him saying: “Sir, I’ll make you a
present of them. You paid me very generously.
Do take them!”</p>

<p>The captain hurried still more saying: “It is
impossible. I don’t want them!”</p>

<p>“Do let me play them for you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>“Not for a thousand devils,” cried the captain,
who had reached the street by this time,
and disappeared quickly. Haydn went at once
to learn both the captain’s and his ship’s name,
and having succeeded, packed up both marches
and, with a note, sent them to the musical salt.
He, however, returned the package without
opening the note, and Haydn was so furious
about it that he tore it to shreds, marches and all.</p>

<h3>Had No Use for Haydn’s Music</h3>

<p>Another time, while Haydn was sauntering
about the streets, he stepped into a music store
and asked if they had a selection of good
music.</p>

<p>“As much as you wish,” said the proprietor.
“Here are some excellent things of Haydn’s!”</p>

<p>“Have no use for them,” said Haydn, curtly.</p>

<p>“What, you have no use for it? For Haydn’s
music! What fault have you to find with it?”</p>

<p>“Quite enough! At any rate, I don’t want
any of it. Show me some other compositions!”</p>

<p>The merchant, a devoted admirer of Haydn’s,
said, indignantly: “It is not necessary, though
I have plenty of excellent music, I have none
for you!” and turned his back on the composer.
At the same moment a gentleman entered who
knew Haydn, and spoke to him. The merchant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
coming up to them said to the Englishman:
“What do you think! This old gentleman here
has no use for Haydn’s music!” Great was
his embarrassment when the gentleman explained.</p>

<h3>Haydn’s Kindness</h3>

<p>The following story proves what a noble, generous
man Haydn was. In 1780 the daughter
of an army officer from Coburg wrote to him of
a little adventure, asking him to set it to music.
This is the story: She and her intended husband,
a captain of the army, together with a
friend and a poodle were taking a walk. The
captain had been praising his dog’s talents, and
made a bet with his friend that the dog would
find a thaler laid under a bush now, he being
sent back for it after their return home. The
bet was accepted. Directly after returning home
the captain sent his dog back for the money.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that a traveling tailor sat
down to rest under that very bush where the
thaler was deposited, found the money and put
it in his pocket. When the poodle arrived he
smelled the coin and fawned upon the tailor.
The man, highly pleased at having found a
thaler and such an amiable dog within an hour,
took him to his stopping place in the town.
The poodle watched the tailor’s clothes all night,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
and when, early the next morning, the door of
the room was opened, he stole out, carrying the
tailor’s trousers with him and brought both them
and the thaler to his master.</p>

<p>This little adventure had been put into verse
under the title: “The Cunning and Serviceable
Poodle,” and Haydn was asked now to put the
text to music. The lady added that she was
poor, but having heard so much of his generosity,
she hoped the enclosed ducat would be considered
sufficient pay.</p>

<p>Haydn went to work at it at once, but returned
the ducat to the young lady in a letter,
saying that as a punishment for not knowing
him better, and sending any money at all, she
should knit him a pair of garters. These garters,
made of white silk with a hand-painted wreath
of violets, Haydn kept with his jewels in his
treasure box.</p>

<h3>Franz Schubert</h3>

<p>For years Schubert could not find a publisher
for even his most famous compositions, such as
the “Erlkoenig,” for instance. In 1823 some
friends and patrons published, at their own expense,
the first twelve books of songs—the same
books that afterwards were to be found all over
the world and brought him thousands.</p>

<h3>Schubert’s Facility</h3>

<p>Schubert composed his songs with amazing
facility. He composed his charming “Serenade”
on the window sill of a country tavern in less
than an hour. He was there on an excursion
with a party of gay friends, who were clamoring
for something new. As soon as he had finished,
they sang it to the delight of all who were fortunate
enough to be within hearing distance.</p>

<h3>Orpheus and His Followers</h3>

<p>Several young wags were making fun of a
musician, and said, among other things, that he
played like Orpheus.</p>

<p>“Very true,” said the musician, “I, too,
seem to have a following of beasts.”</p>

<h3>Carpenter and Weber</h3>

<p>Some time ago I asked B, my carpenter, why
he was so downhearted.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “you know, sir, that my
son Franz was to have been a carpenter. He
showed a good deal of talent for it, but now it’s
all over.”</p>

<p>“How so?” I asked.</p>

<p>“It happened this way: We went to hear an
opera the other night, and such music as we
heard! The angels in heaven could not sing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
any better, and that music they said was made
by one Weber. And now my boy won’t be anything
else but just such a Weber” (Weaver).</p>

<h3>Singing by Sight</h3>

<p>To the manager of the opera at K. came one
day a young girl to be examined for a position
in the chorus. After she had sung a scale, he
asked her among other questions if she could
sing by sight, to which she replied: “Oh yes,
if I know it by heart.”</p>

<p>“Are you at all musical?”</p>

<p>“Oh no; I am Catholic!”</p>

<h3>Shoes Versus Music</h3>

<p>The younger Pixis was to play at Hanover a
concert of Mozart’s. His father kept him hard
at practicing, but he seemed listless and paid
very little attention to his playing. The elder
Pixis, very anxious that all his sons should succeed,
chided him and said: “There is still
time for you to learn something else. If you
do not care to make a virtuoso of yourself, you
might make a cobbler.”</p>

<p>“Well, what loss would that be,” replied the
little fellow. “Anybody can do without music,
but not without shoes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<h3>They Knew Nothing</h3>

<p>One time it occurred to a village organist,
that by having some new church music, he
might not only glorify a coming festival, but
cover himself also with glory before his congregation.
Telemann, the well-known composer
of sacred music, who lived in the near-by city of
Gotha, should compose it, and his colleagues
from the surrounding villages with their choirs,
should help in the rendition of it. So to Telemann
the ambitious organist betook himself,
and explained his errand. Now the composer
knew him and his <i>confrères</i> as miserable bunglers,
and made all sorts of excuses, but the
organist was persistent and would not be refused.
Telemann, partly angry, partly amused, asked
at last what the text for the cantata was to be.
That the organist said he would leave to Telemann
to choose, a Bible text or something
equally appropriate would do. The composer
finally consented, and asked him to arrange for
the rehearsal, to which he promised to come
himself and bring some friends.</p>

<p>The morning of the festival brought Telemann
and his friends. The scores were distributed.
For the text the composer had chosen
the line: “We know nothing against the Lord!”
and had put it into a fugue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>“Now,” whispered Telemann to his friends,
“listen to those fellows confessing their sins!”
The rehearsal began, and from all throats came,
like a tremendous wailing, “We—we—we know
nothing—nothing—nothing—we know nothing—know
nothing—no”—until at last, the whole
company having shouted away for dear life—without
suspecting anything wrong—was awakened
from their dream, by shouts of laughter
from Telemann and his friends. Then there
was general consternation, the poor organist
stood completely crushed. “To be sure, this
does not sound very well, gentlemen,” said Telemann,
and to comfort the crestfallen organist he
drew from his pocket another small cantata,
which he and his friends rendered at the church.</p>

<h3>A Lucrative Position</h3>

<p>Goldmark, the composer of “The Queen of
Saba,” while traveling one day, found himself
in a railway <i>coupé</i> with a strange lady. A conversation
was soon started, and the composer
introduced himself with these words: “I am
Goldmark, the composer of The Queen of Saba.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” replied the lady, who was not much
versed in musical or theatrical matters, “that
must be a very lucrative position.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<h3>Ludwig van Beethoven</h3>

<p>Beethoven’s parents had him instructed in
music at a very early age. When he was only
eight years old he played the violin so well as
to astonish all his hearers. In the little room
under the roof, where he practiced, he noticed
one day a very large spider, leaving her web
and coming close to him to listen. By and by
she grew so tame, that she came and sat first on
his desk, then on the artist, and finally made
herself at home on the arm which held the bow.
Her interest spurred on the boy to do his best,
and helped not a little in his progress. One
day, his aunt, who filled his mother’s place,
came into the little room, bringing a friend who
wished to hear the boy play. As he began, the
spider came from her corner and settled upon
his arm. The aunt seeing the insect, pounced
upon her, and crushed her under her foot.
Beethoven, horror-stricken at his comrade’s fate,
fell fainting to the floor.</p>

<h3>He Beat the Emperor</h3>

<p>Once while at court, Beethoven forgot himself
so far as to beat the time on the back of
Emperor Francis. The monarch was not the
least angry, and often said smilingly, that one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
of his subjects had beaten him, without being
punished for it.</p>

<h3>Brains Versus an Estate</h3>

<p>Beethoven’s younger brother had, by extreme
economy, saved enough to purchase a country
estate. One time he sent to his famous brother,
just to anger him, a New Year’s card with:
“Johann van Beethoven, possessor of a country
estate;” to which polite action, he received the
answer: “Ludwig van Beethoven, possessor of
brains.”</p>

<h3>Forgot to Eat</h3>

<p>Beethoven dined now and then at an inn on
the flour-market at Vienna. One day he came
at half past two, and sat down in his lonely corner,
without greeting any of the guests present, a
courtesy he had never before omitted. The
waiter who knew him, brought him a bottle of
the ordinary table wine which Beethoven usually
drank, and put the menu before him.</p>

<p>The great composer broke his roll, pulled a
notebook from his pocket, leaned his head on
his hand and remained in this attitude, writing
now and then in the book, until six o’clock in
the evening. Suddenly he jumped up and cried:
“Waiter, I wish to pay my bill!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, but your Honor has not eaten a thing
to-day!”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I? Well, all right!” said Beethoven,
and took his hat and went out.</p>

<h3>Beethoven’s Poverty</h3>

<p>The great composer’s gruff, even repulsive
manner, during the last years of his life, was
partly owing to his deafness and partly to the utter
ruin of his finances. He was not a good
manager, and had the misfortune to be robbed
by those in his employ. He often lacked the
necessities of life. Ludwig Spohr, in the early
days of his acquaintance with Beethoven asked
him once why he had not been to dinner at the
inn for some days. Had he been ill?</p>

<p>“No, but my boot was, and as I own only one
pair, I had to stay at home.”</p>

<h3>Beethoven’s Domestic Troubles</h3>

<p>The best idea of his domestic misery is given
in his diary, an extract from which is here presented.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">1819. January 31:</p>

<p>Dismissed the housekeeper, on account of her
quick tongue and quicker temper.</p>

<p class="indent3">February 15:</p>

<p>The new cook arrives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p class="indent3">March 8:</p>

<p>The cook has given two weeks’ notice. On
the 22d the new housekeeper takes charge.</p>

<p class="indent3">April 14:</p>

<p>Engaged a waitress at six gulden per month.</p>

<p class="indent3">April 20:</p>

<p>The housekeeper gives notice, because she is
no good.</p>

<p class="indent3">April 24:</p>

<p>Bad day. Could not eat anything,—that is,
there was nothing fit to eat, everything being
spoiled, standing too long.</p>

<p class="indent3">May 16:</p>

<p>Cook has given notice, because she ruined the
dinner again.</p>

<p class="indent3">July 1:</p>

<p>Enter a new cook. I wonder if she is good
for anything!</p>

</div>

<p>Such was the great master’s domestic life.</p>

<h3>Indifference to Dress and Fashion</h3>

<p>That Beethoven paid no heed whatever to the
world, its fashions or its follies, during the time
when he worked hardest, showed in his appearance.
For instance, he had not noticed that it
had become the fashion for men to wear lace
frills on the front of their shirts. A friend ordered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
some for him, so that he should appear well
dressed. When Beethoven saw the frills he
wondered what they were for. “Oh,” he said,
“I suppose they are meant to keep me warm,”
and tucked the beautiful frills inside his vest.</p>

<h3>Remedy for Ennui</h3>

<p>When Liszt made his first trip to St. Petersburg,
Russia had no railroads, and he traveled
over badly neglected roads in a heavily loaded
coach, with his secretary and valet. One day,
not far from the small town of P—— the coach
broke down. Examination showed that it would
take at least two days to repair it. This forced
Liszt to go to the hotel of the town, a place that
could neither offer him his accustomed comforts
nor luxuries nor anything in the way of amusements.</p>

<p>Liszt was then at the height of his triumphant
career, and all the joys and pleasures of life
were his. To such a man the enforced rest in
such a poor place, must have been depressing.
Under these circumstances it was a happy
thought that came to the secretary while reading
a poem of Alfred de Musset. In it the poet
says: “La reméde au melancolique c’est la
musique.” “The remedy for melancholy is
music.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>The artist was lying in an easy chair by the
fire, watching the smoke from his Havana, when
the secretary proposed to kill time by giving
some concerts. Solely in the hope of getting a
change and some diversion out of it, Liszt
laughingly consented. Quickly the necessary
arrangements were made and the concert was to
be given on the following night in the dancing
hall of the hotel.</p>

<p>Now either the virtuoso’s fame had not penetrated
so far, or else they doubted that he was the
genuine, great Liszt, for when the artist stepped
on the platform, he looked at a yawning gulf of
empty chairs. About fifteen persons were
present.</p>

<p>Taking off his gloves, he looked smilingly at
the little band of faithful ones, then came forward
and, in the amiable, merry way he had of talking,
he pointed out to them that the hall was
cold and uncomfortable, while his own sitting-room
was warm and cozy. He took the liberty
therefore to ask those present to follow him and
to take a little supper with him. And offering
his arm to the young lady sitting next to him
he led the way, while the rest followed not a
little surprised, but full of curiosity.</p>

<p>With the help of his secretary and valet, he
gave them quite a supper with champagne, Liszt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
making a most fascinating host, and sitting
down to the piano unasked, he played for the
mixed company some national airs, which were
jubilantly applauded. It was a highly enjoyable
evening for the guests and even more so
for the host, who thanked his secretary warmly.</p>

<p>The next evening the second concert took
place, and the hall was crowded. Whether
they came in the hope of being invited to supper
or whether their interest in music was aroused
is hard to decide. Liszt laughingly inclined to
the former. At any rate, the concert was a
brilliant success, the whole aristocracy of the
neighborhood was present, greeting him with
storms of applause. After the concert, they
overwhelmed him with invitations, so that the
great artist was obliged to extend his stay to a
week. He always recalled this as one of his
merriest traveling experiences.</p>

<h3>Paganini and the Cab Driver</h3>

<p>Among the great <i>maestro’s</i> papers was found
the following amusing story: “One day,”
Paganini begins, “I was wandering about the
streets of Vienna, when all of a sudden a thunder-storm
came up. The rain came down in
torrents and seemed to increase every minute.
For once I was alone, which happened very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
rarely, as my valet generally accompanied me.
I was very far from my lodgings and already so
wet, that I was beginning to fear for my health.
So I looked about for a cab. Three passed me,
as the drivers did not understand Italian, and I
did not speak German. The fourth stopped at
my call, the driver was a countryman of mine.</p>

<p>“Before entering I asked his price. ‘Five
gulden, the price of a ticket to Paganini’s concert,’
he said.</p>

<p>“‘You rascal,’ I cried indignantly, ‘to ask
five gulden for such a short ride! Paganini
plays on one string of his violin; you could
hardly run your cab on one wheel.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, it isn’t so difficult as people think, to
play on one string. I am musical too, and I
doubled the price of my fares to-day, in order
to hear the great violinist they call Paganini.’</p>

<p>“I said nothing more, entered the cab, and in
ten minutes was at my hotel. I gave the man
the five gulden and also a ticket to my concert.
The next day just before the concert began, a
great crowd was at the door of the concert hall
when I arrived, and one of the ushers called to
me: ‘There is a dirty, uncouth-looking man at
the door, who insists on being admitted.’</p>

<p>“It was my driver of the day before, whom
I permitted to enter in spite of his appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
hoping that he would lose himself in the crowd.
But when, at the beginning of the concert, I
stepped on the platform, there he was as close
to me as he could get, among the elegantly
dressed women of the first row. The applause
was enthusiastic; my driver’s knew no bounds.
Several times he had to be severely reproved for
disturbing the rest of the audience. I never
had a more appreciative listener.</p>

<p>“Early the next morning he came to my
rooms. ‘Sir,’ he said, in the most respectful
tone, ‘you can do me a great favor. I have a
family, am poor, and your countryman; you
are wealthy and famous. You hold my fortune
in your hand.’</p>

<p>“‘What do you mean by that?’</p>

<p>“‘Permit me to put at the back of my cab
the two words: “Paganini’s cabriolet.”’</p>

<p>“‘Very well,’ said I laughingly, ‘you may
put on it whatever you like.’</p>

<p>“That man was smarter than I thought. In
a few months he was better known at Vienna
than myself; his Paganini cab created a sensation.
He had great good luck with it, for
everybody wanted to ride in it and he charged
good prices.</p>

<p>“When I returned to Vienna two years later,
my driver was the owner of the hotel at which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
I had stayed, and an Englishman had bought
the cabriolet for one thousand pounds.”</p>

<h3>Meyerbeer’s Preference</h3>

<p>Meyerbeer’s nephew came to Rossini, to beg
of him to listen to a funeral march he had
composed on the death of his uncle, and to pass
his judgment upon it.</p>

<p>After Rossini had listened patiently he said:</p>

<p>“That is all very well. Yet, I should like it
better if you had died and your uncle had composed
the funeral march.”</p>

<h3>Rossini and His Watch</h3>

<p>The famous composer possessed a magnificent
watch that his king had presented to him.
It was a repeater and also a musical watch, for
it played the <i>maestro’s</i> prayer from “Moses in
Egypt.” But not until after he had owned it
for six years, did he understand it fully. Rossini
took a boyish delight in showing it and
making it play, and one day he did so while in
a café.</p>

<p>A stranger who sat near was attracted by the
music, and just as Rossini was going to put it
back in his pocket, he stepped up to him and
said: “You have a very valuable watch there,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
sir, but I’ll wager that you do not know all its
capabilities.”</p>

<p>Rossini, much surprised said: “I have carried
it now for six years, in honor of my king.
It has never varied one minute, it repeats the
hour, quarter-hour, tells the minutes and the
day of the month, and plays as you have just
heard, the prayer from ‘Moses.’”</p>

<p>“And yet, I insist,” said the stranger smilingly,
“that you do not know your watch
wholly. I’ll wager anything you like,—your
watch against ten thousand francs!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if you have ten thousand francs
too many, I’ll take the bet,” cried Rossini;
“but now give me the proof of your assertion.”</p>

<p>“Very well,—the watch plays another piece
of yours, master, and contains your portrait
besides.”</p>

<p>Speechless, Rossini saw that when the stranger
touched a spring a lid flew back, disclosing his
portrait, while at the same time it played “Di
Tanti Palpiti” from “Tancred.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” he exclaimed, looking at
his lost watch, “it is true, you have won the
wager; but how could I know?”</p>

<p>The stranger, laughing heartily, handed him
back his treasure saying:</p>

<p>“I am the maker of this watch, Michel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
Plivée. The wager was made in fun, but I am
delighted, that you, the great <i>maestro</i>, take
such pleasure in my work.”</p>

<h3>He Didn’t Mean It</h3>

<p>The well-known pianist, Sophie Menter, delighted
everybody with her simple, natural ways.
One day in Pesth, while in a company of artists
and lovers of art, Liszt among them, a young
count, carried away by her playing, cried enthusiastically,</p>

<p>“Mein Fräulein, I lay myself at your feet!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sophie Menter, stepping back
and smiling roguishly, “go on, lie down!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I did not mean it literally like that,”
replied the count in consternation.</p>

<p>“Now you see,” said the young girl seriously,
“that you should never say what you do
not honestly mean.”</p>

<h3>How a Fugue Was Made</h3>

<p>Kirnberger, the son of a carpenter, was taught
music at an early age. One day he sat in a
corner of his father’s workshop, poring over a
task his teacher had set him. Every now and
then the boy would sigh deeply, and rub his
forehead vigorously. His father who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
been watching him for some time, at last
asked:</p>

<p>“Well, my boy, what is the trouble?”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, I am to make a fugue, and I do
not know how to begin!” Now fugue, in German,
means also the groove in a board.</p>

<p>“You silly fellow, why couldn’t you ask me.
Come right here and I’ll show you.” The good
man took up a board, put his plane to it, and
tried to show to his son how a fugue was made.</p>

<h3>At the Railway Station</h3>

<p>L:—“Ah, how do you do, my dear sir; where
do you come from?”</p>

<p>D:—“From Karlsbad.”</p>

<p>L:—“Well, how did the waters agree with
you?”</p>

<p>D:—“Not very well. I was there six weeks
and am still as stout as ever. Towards the last
I drank fourteen cups of water a day, and still
did not lose anything to speak of.”</p>

<p>L:—“You should have gone to Wiesbaden. I
was there only two days, didn’t drink anything,
and yet lost everything.”</p>

<h3>Why He Curtained the Window</h3>

<p>Tourist (to hotelkeeper):—“Will you tell me
why you curtained the window of my room from
the outside?”</p>

<p>Host:—“Excuse me, sir, but you wanted a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
cheap room, without a view; and as I had only
this one with a view, but could not rent that at
your price, we just put the curtain on the outside.”</p>

<h3>No Cause for Alarm</h3>

<p>Stranger (at a mountain tavern):—“Say,
mine host, what is that dreadful rumbling noise
above?”</p>

<p>Host:—“Dear me, I suppose the tavern is
going to tumble down; it’s very rickety. But
that’s nothing. If it doesn’t kill us, we’ll build
a new one next year, and will hope to see you
and your friends.”</p>

<h3>Sticking to the Date</h3>

<p>Official (to conductor, who is hours behind
with his train):—“What made you so late?”</p>

<p>Conductor:—“We don’t run by hours and
minutes, we just stick to the date!”</p>

<h3>A Tough Parrot</h3>

<p>A gentleman farmer, from Pomerania, visited
Vienna. At a bird dealer’s, a talking parrot excited
his greatest admiration. He paid two
hundred gulden for him and had him sent home
to his friend Gela. After his return he called
on him and of course asked for the parrot.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
“Oh,” said his friend, “many thanks for your
kind attention. He was a little tough, though.”</p>

<p>“What? the parrot?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, he had to be cooked for six
hours.”</p>

<p>“What? Did you cook that parrot?”</p>

<p>“Why of course we did.”</p>

<p>“Gela, you are a fool. That was a trained
bird; he could talk.”</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t he say so?”</p>

<h3>Always Demonstrating</h3>

<p>Professor (on his wedding tour in the mountains):—“Don’t
go too near that precipice,
Elise, you might fall down.”</p>

<p>Young wife (laughing):—“Oh no, I should
take hold of that pine tree there.”</p>

<p>Professor:—“That is a fir tree, my dear!
Just see how careless you are! You would take
hold of a pine tree and when you got there,
there would not be one to hold onto!”</p>

<p>Tourist (to a farmer’s wife):—“Well, my
good woman, where is your husband to-day?
Isn’t he at home?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>“No, he’s up on the Alps.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid to be all alone?”</p>

<p>“Goodness no! I am always glad when he
is gone, then I have some peace!”</p>

<p>“But, my dear woman, you ought not to say
that! Man and wife belong together. I am
always glad when my wife is at home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, while you are gadding about!”</p>

<h3>Constant Change</h3>

<p>Stranger:—“How high is this mountain?”</p>

<p>Guide:—“My father always said eight thousand
five hundred feet. But you can’t depend
upon that; father died thirty-eight years ago,
and since that time lots of things have changed.”</p>

<h3>On the Alps</h3>

<p>“Look here, guide; on that signpost down
below, it says it takes one hour to come up here,
and it has taken us almost three!”</p>

<p>“I know that, but if we put that on the signpost
not a decent feller would come up here.”</p>

<h3>A Striking Resemblance</h3>

<p>Countess (who has returned to her estate in
the mountains for the summer):—“Well, Sepp,
are you all glad to see me back again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>Sepp:—“Oh my, yes! When you are not
here the castle looks to us like an Alp without
the cattle.”</p>

<h3>How to Secure Notoriety</h3>

<p>Stranger:—“Why don’t you put a railing
along this dreadful abyss?”</p>

<p>Guide:—“Well, you know the more strangers
that fall down there, the more famous the abyss
becomes!”</p>

<h3>Complimentary</h3>

<p>Captain (to ladies on a steamer):—“Ladies,
please do not look so long at the compass, your
magnetic eyes will spoil the course!”</p>

<h3>Running Water</h3>

<p>Summer boarder:—“You said you had running
water in the yard, but I can see only a
pump.”</p>

<p>Farmer:—“You just pull a little and it runs!”</p>

<h3>A Scarcity of Something</h3>

<p>Traveler:—“Milk must be very scarce around
here that you ask so much for it?”</p>

<p>Hostess:—“The milk is not scarce at all, sir,
but travelers are!”</p>

<h3>Ruin Enough</h3>

<p>Wife (at a watering place):—“Well, dear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
Emil, shall we stay here on the promenade or
climb up to the ruin?”</p>

<p>Husband:—“What should I climb up to the
ruin for? To have to stay here four weeks is
ruin enough for me!”</p>

<h3>Flooded</h3>

<p>A lady who had been to Italy for the first
time was asked, after her return, how she liked
Venice. “Oh, quite well,” she answered, “I
was only unfortunate in finding the whole place
flooded.”</p>

<h3>Marking the Spot</h3>

<p>She (in a railway carriage):—“Why, Albert,
what are you doing there? You are cutting
into the window sill!”</p>

<p>He:—“I’m only marking the place where
we had the most beautiful view.”</p>

<h3>A Drawback to Wealth</h3>

<p>“But mamma, why are we so afraid of a
thunder-storm? The other people on the beach
don’t seem to be frightened. No others are running
home as we are!”</p>

<p>“Why, child, those are poor people. They
don’t draw the lightning as we do, who always
have a lot of gold and silver about us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<h3>Appreciative Tourist</h3>

<p>“Have you been away during vacation,
Doctor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was in Thüringen, gracious Frau, in
Eisenach, and on the memorable Wartburg.”</p>

<p>“On the Wartburg! Ah, I remember; isn’t
that where they have the beautiful waiting-rooms?”</p>

<h3>Prays for All Poor Sinners</h3>

<p>“Where are you going, Rosel?”</p>

<p>“To mass.”</p>

<p>“Do you pray there for everybody, myself
included?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, your Honor; I pray for all poor
sinners.”</p>

<h3>What a Pity</h3>

<p>Owner of a villa:—“What do you think of
these pine woods—this spicy odor! You have,
perhaps, a consumptive in your family?”</p>

<p>Gentleman:—“No, thank God!”</p>

<p>Owner:—“What a pity!”</p>

<h3>The Altitude of the Depth</h3>

<p>Guide (descending with a party into a deep
abyss):—“So, now around the corner, and a
few hundred feet further down. Then we will
have reached the altitude of the depth!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<h3>Couldn’t Hear the Waterfall</h3>

<p>Guide:—“When the ladies are through talking,
your Honor will be able to hear the waterfall
over there!”</p>

<h3>Beautiful Sunsets</h3>

<p>Stranger:—“You are a happy people up here
in the mountains; you always have the beautiful
spectacle of the rising and setting sun before
you!”</p>

<p>Farmer:—“Yes; but excuse me, doesn’t that
happen in the city, too?”</p>

<h3>Soft and Tender</h3>

<p>Clerk (on the Rigi):—“Gracious, how this
glorious sunset makes a fellow feel soft and
tender. Just now they are closing the offices at
home in Frankfort!”</p>

<h3>Misunderstood</h3>

<p>Physician (to a newly-arrived guest at a
water-cure):—“The nature of your illness requires
that you follow the rules here strictly.
Drink three glasses of water every morning;
after each glass, walk for half an hour. Exercise
is the main thing. Strict diet’! Three cigars
a day: one after breakfast, one after dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
one after supper. Come to see me again in
three days.”</p>

<p>Physician (after three days):—“Well, how
does the cure agree with you?”</p>

<p>Guest:—“Thank you, Doctor; so far, quite
well. If I only did not feel so sick afterwards.”</p>

<p>Physician:—“Feel sick? After what?
Doesn’t the water agree with you?”</p>

<p>Guest:—“Oh yes, that isn’t it, but the cigars—I
never smoked before!”</p>

<h3>The East Wind</h3>

<p>Guide:—“Yes, sir; it is an immense advantage
to us that we nearly always have an east
wind.”</p>

<p>Stranger:—“Is that statistic?”</p>

<p>Guide:—“I have kept an account of it for
years.”</p>

<p>Stranger:—“But pardon me, if you will look
at the weather vane on that tower you will see
that the wind is west.”</p>

<p>Guide:—“Oh, well, that’s the east wind
coming back.”</p>

<h3>Frozen Music</h3>

<p>Banker:—“If architecture is said to be frozen
music, what would you call a Sennhütte?” (a
hut on the Alps).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>Professor:—“Why, a frozen Schnadahüpfel
(senner’s song), my dear friend!”</p>

<h3>Need Not be Told</h3>

<p>Nervous lady (to the boatman before the
famous echo on the Königssee):—“Won’t you
please tell me when they are going to shoot?”</p>

<p>Boatman:—“You’ll hear it soon enough, I
won’t have to tell you first!”</p>

<h3>Cheap Pleasure</h3>

<p>A:—“I can’t understand why people always
complain about mountain excursions being so
expensive. I just took a two days’ trip again,
and except for a bowl of milk, I didn’t spend a
cent.”</p>

<p>B:—“What are you giving me, why you
must have starved!”</p>

<p>A:—“Why of course not. I had a cold
roast goose, a dozen hard-boiled eggs, a piece
of ham, and two bottles of wine, with me. You
don’t starve on that!”</p>

<h3>No Need of Cows</h3>

<p>Stranger (to his host, a peasant on the Alps):</p>

<p>“Your butter is certainly very poor.”</p>

<p>“If you please, it’s our own butter!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>“Why, you just told me you had sold all
your cows.”</p>

<p>“Does the gentleman think we are so far
behind the times, that we need cows to make
our own butter?”</p>

<h3>Had His Choice</h3>

<p>Guide (on the summit of the Alps):—“Look
out, your Honor; if you fall down
backward, you will be buried at Partenkirchen;
and if you fall forward, at Lermos!”</p>

<h3>A New Driver</h3>

<p>Tourist (to guide):—“What will the team
cost for the trip?”</p>

<p>“Seven gulden.”</p>

<p>“That is too much. Here in my Bädeker it
says: Trip including a tip, five gulden.”</p>

<p>“Well, then you just let Bädeker drive you!”</p>

<h3>Wanted a Cheap Bath</h3>

<p>Economical stranger (at a bathing establishment):—“How
much do you charge for a
bath?”</p>

<p>Cashier:—“One mark.”</p>

<p>Stranger:—“Couldn’t you fix one for me
for half a mark? You might give me a little
less water!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<h3>At Home on the Lake</h3>

<p>Stranger (on the lake):—“You had better
row ashore, my man; the waves are getting
very high; the boat might upset, and I should
be lost!”</p>

<p>Boatman:—“You need not be afraid, sir; I
am at home on the water. A stranger was
drowned here only last week, but we found his
body the very next day.”</p>

<h3>Imported Air</h3>

<p>“I am surprised that the air in this miserable
town is so fine! I wonder how it is!”</p>

<p>“That comes from the quantity of Swiss
cheese that’s consumed here!”</p>

<p>“Why, what has that to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Well, just think what immense quantities
of Swiss air are imported yearly, in the pores of
that cheese!”</p>

<h3>A New Flavor</h3>

<p>Guest:—“I had two portions of coffee for
breakfast; how much?”</p>

<p>Waiter:—“Beg pardon, sir, did you have it
with or without sunrise?”</p>

<h3>A Matter of Looks</h3>

<p>A guest comes to a country tavern and asks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
for a glass of beer and a piece of cheese. As
the latter does not look very appetizing, he calls
the host and asks him to bring a nicer piece.
He simply turns the slice over, so that the
better looking side is turned up and says:
“There you are!”</p>

<h3>Flattered</h3>

<p>Author (at a mountain inn, reading a fresh
newspaper, left by a newcomer):—“...
What! the King of Haïti is thinking of getting
married?... Hm, hm! I wonder if he has
read my article on the necessity of marrying!”</p>

<i>On Cycling</i></h2>

</div>

<h3>Street Scene of the Future</h3>

<p>Ordinance: Every foot passenger will
carry a visible number and will ring a bell on
approaching a cycler. Riding and driving
strictly forbidden.</p>

<h3>Luck</h3>

<p>Cycler (passing a carriage on the road):—“And
still there are cabs—to-day, when the
cycle rules the world! They are a funny
sight!... Of course an old woman is in it;
who else would use one of those antediluvian
vehicles?”</p>

<p>(Half an hour later, he and his wheel have
been picked up by the occupant of that carriage,
both badly bruised and battered):—“What
luck, that this cab came along! I wonder
how I would have gotten home without it!”</p>

<h3>Lies Elsewhere</h3>

<p>Lady (on her wheel, meeting the Herr<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Förster, an acquaintance):—“Please, Herr
Förster, in what direction does Lahnberg lie?
I am riding there to meet my husband who is
on his new wheel.”</p>

<p>“Lahnberg lies about two miles from here on
the road to the right—your husband lies to the
left.”</p>

<h3>A Pair of Them</h3>

<p>A:—“How is your wife?”</p>

<p>B:—“I see her very seldom now.”</p>

<p>A:—“Why, how is that?”</p>

<p>B:—“Well, you see, she always sits behind
me on the tandem.”</p>

<h3>Effect</h3>

<p>Piano repairer:—“It’s strange that every
week a pedal gets broken on this piano.”</p>

<p>Footman:—“It’s because our young lady
rides a wheel all day.”</p>

<h3>Too Early to Talk</h3>

<p>(Two wheelmen, one of whom is a beginner,
pass each other.)</p>

<p>A:—“I see you are getting on very well!”</p>

<p>B:—“Oh yes, for so short a time, I—(falls
from his wheel)—you know, my friend,
I ought not to talk yet!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<h3>Wouldn’t Appear Ridiculous</h3>

<p>Policeman (to a cycler):—“In this street
cycling is forbidden; get off at once!”</p>

<p>Cycler:—“My name is Meyer, policeman,
and I live Tulpenplatz 277. Send for the fine—but
don’t make me look ridiculous before all
these people. I can neither mount nor get
off by myself; I can only ride.”</p>

<h3>Each to His Need</h3>

<p>Waitress (calling into the kitchen at a country
tavern):—“For the gentleman vegetarian a little
green fodder, and for his steel horse a drop of
oil!”</p>

<h3>What Papa Brought Home from His Trip</h3>

<p>Papa (bringing his wheel in):—“Come here,
wifey, and bring all the children! Now, all of
you open your mouths wide, I am going to open
the pneumatic tubes, that I filled on the Arlberg
with delicious mountain air for you!”</p>

<h3>A New Word</h3>

<p>A:—“Who is that gentleman in that sporty
costume?”</p>

<p>B:—“That is a teacher of cycling.”</p>

<p>A:—“Oh, a sort of velocipedagogue.”</p>

<i>Authors, Scientists, Artists, and other Celebrities</i></h2>

</div>

<h3>Immanuel Kant and His Hostess</h3>

<p>The great philosopher was extremely careful
about his dress. One day, having donned a new
suit, he went for a walk, and in passing a house
a careless servant threw some dish-water on him.
He expressed his anger in a very lively fashion
and went at once into the house from which the
girl had come. The daughter of the house received
him with many excuses, assuring him that
all damage might be avoided if he would permit
her to wash the spots off at once. Kant
kept on scolding until the young woman had removed
all traces of the mishap. She, who knew
him very well, asked his name just for mischief,
and when he had told her she said: “I am delighted,
to have had this occasion to meet you.”</p>

<p>“I too am pleased to have made your acquaintance,”
replied Kant, “but not with the
occasion that brought it about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it is just the occasion that pleases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
me so much,” said the young woman, “for if
anybody accuses me of vanity after this, because
I am very particular about my clothes, I shall
tell them that I am following the example of the
great Kant.”</p>

<h3>The Church Steeples</h3>

<p>At an evening company a number of anecdotes
were told of some great man. “I remember to
have heard similar anecdotes of other great men,”
said Kant, “but that is not surprising; great
men are like church-steeples, around both is
generally a great deal of wind.”</p>

<h3>Goethe as a Skater</h3>

<p>One day Goethe made one of a skating party.
His mother and a friend were sitting in a sleigh
watching the skaters. Goethe came up to them,
took his mother’s long cloak off, hung it around
himself, darted to and fro on the ice, cutting the
funniest capers for some time before he brought
it back to her.</p>

<h3>Goethe as a Ghost</h3>

<p>Goethe often bathed at night in the Ilm. One
beautiful summer night, when the moon shone
full on the poetic swimmer, a countryman on
his way to Upper-Weimar, wanted to make a
short cut, by climbing over the gate of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
castle’s bridge. Goethe saw him and in one of
his mad moods, which set Weimar so often in
commotion, he uttered the most unearthly yells
and shrieks, while jumping up and down in the
water. Those terrible sounds coming from a
white figure with long, floating black hair, terrified
the countryman so much, that he turned and
fled as if possessed.</p>

<h3>Goethe’s Gallantry</h3>

<p>One evening Wieland was reading aloud to a
large company, assembled at the country house
of the Dowager Duchess Amelia of Tiefurth.
The reigning Duke, who had been out hunting,
came in during the reading, found the room too
warm and opened one of the windows. Some
ladies thinly clad sat close to it. Goethe observing
that they suffered, tiptoed to the window and
shut it softly. The Duke turning around, saw
that some one had resisted his wish. “Who
has shut the window, that I opened?” he asked
the servants, but not one dared to mention the
culprit. Goethe however, stepped forward and
with an arch gravity said: “Your Highness has
the power of life and death over all your subjects.
Upon me let judgment and sentence be
pronounced.” The Duke laughed, but the window
was not opened again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<h3>Goethe or the Devil</h3>

<p>Of another evening’s reading, Falk von Muller
relates: Goethe had come in, unnoticed by anybody,
and sat down close to the reader, with his
back turned to the audience. After a while he
offered to read. At first everything went beautifully;
then he began to extemporize and his
exuberant spirits getting the better of him, he
put everybody out of countenance in one way or
another. In a little fable, in doggerel verses, he
likened me wittily enough, to a worthy turkey-hen,
that sits on a great heap of eggs of her own
and other people’s, and hatches them with great
patience, but to whom it sometimes happens to
have a china egg put under her instead of a real
one, a trick at which she takes no offense.</p>

<p>“That is either Goethe or the devil,” cried I
to Wieland, who sat opposite to me at the table.</p>

<p>“Both,” replied he; “he has the devil in him
again to-day and he is like a wanton colt,
that flings out before and behind, and you do
well not to go too near him.” Years after, we
often laughed over that evening’s performance.</p>

<h3>Schiller’s Witty Reply</h3>

<p>When a youth, Schiller learned to play the
harp. A neighbor who did not like him, said
to him one day: “Herr Schiller, you play the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
harp like David, only not as well.” “And
you,” Schiller replied, quickly, “talk like
Solomon, only not so wisely.”</p>

<h3>Schiller’s Birthplace</h3>

<p>In a company the conversation turned to
Schiller. One lady confessed she did not know
where Schiller was born. “For goodness sake,
keep still, don’t let anybody hear you,” said her
friend; “have you not read the poem: ‘I, too,
was born in Arcadia’?”</p>

<h3>The Difference</h3>

<p>Bishop Ross, famous for his brilliant wit and
fine humor, was discussing with some friends a
new book, “Thoughts about Time and Eternity,”
when some one, who found fault with the
title, asked him to explain to him the difference
between time and eternity. “If I took the
time to explain that to you, it would take me an
eternity to make you understand it,” was the
bishop’s answer.</p>

<h3>An Appropriate Text</h3>

<p>During a celebration at Berlin, followed by
the distribution of some orders, an old general
asked Count Ross whether it was not very hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
for clergymen always to find an appropriate
Bible text, for sermons on special occasions.
“Not as hard as you think,” replied the bishop,
“we have our concordance and other books of
help, which never fail us.”</p>

<p>“What text would be proper for the present
celebration?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is not hard; you will find it at the
beginning of St. Matthew, at the birth of Christ,
where the evangelist says of the three wise men:
‘And when they saw <i>the star</i>, they rejoiced
with exceeding great joy.’”</p>

<h3>A Flash of Wit</h3>

<p>Carl Lachmann was famed for his witty answers.
In 1828 he was called to Berlin as rector
of the University. One time he was presiding
at a meeting of the faculty. It had grown late
and pretty dark, when H., the dean of the
theological department, entered. On seeing
him, Lachmann called to the usher: “Herr
Schade, have the lights brought; darkness has
entered.”</p>

<h3>The Other Half</h3>

<p>A colleague, who had married a wealthy
woman, and who liked to show off, asked Lachmann:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
“What do you think the addition to my
house has cost me?”</p>

<p>“Half,” was the dry, curt answer.</p>

<h3>A Grave Joke</h3>

<p>When a friend informed him of the death of
the minister of finances, Lachmann said seriously:
“Yes, death comes easy enough to such
as he, but the likes of us must first give up his
soul.”</p>

<h3>Linné’s Revenge</h3>

<p>Linné, the great naturalist, followed the
principle of never taking notice of criticism.
His bitterest opponent was Browall—a small
light beside the great scientist. At first Browall’s
behavior was very humble and modest, so
Linné called a plant, of which only one species
was known at that time “Browallia demissa”
(demure or modest Browallia). Later on, after
Browall had been advanced, he acted the high
and mighty towards Linné, and he, having
found a second species of his plant called it,
“Browallia elata” (elated Browallia). At this
Browall was very angry and wrote a great
number of excited articles against Linné, who
avenged himself further by naming a third
species of the plant “Browallia alienata”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
(alienated Browallia). In this way he certainly
took a lasting revenge, for this anecdote will live
as long as botany lives.</p>

<h3>Never Drank Water</h3>

<p>When the poet Hagedorn was mortally ill, he
asked his physician, what his illness was.</p>

<p>“Water, my dear Hagedorn, too much water
in your breast.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s entirely impossible,” replied
Hagedorn; “I never drank, in all my life, a
whole glass of water.”</p>

<h3>A Great Advantage</h3>

<p>A professor once undertook the hard task of
translating Virgil into Greek and publishing it.
In the announcement of his work he said: “<i>In
gratiam corum, qui Latinam linguam non
callent</i>” (For the benefit of those who do not
understand Latin).</p>

<h3>Thorwaldsen’s Teeth</h3>

<p>A well-known sculptor quarreled one day
with Thorwaldsen, and went so far as to place
his own works above those of the latter. “You
may tie my hands,” said Thorwaldsen, “and I
will bite the marble with my teeth better than
you can chisel it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<h3>Gone Crazy</h3>

<p>A scientist asserts that all effervescent drinks,
such as champagne, are nothing but fluids, gone
crazy over the treatment they received at the
factories, and foaming with rage.</p>

<h3>Anything But His Medicine</h3>

<p>Gottfried Kneller, a celebrated portrait
painter, had a beautiful flower-garden. His
neighbor, Dr. Ratcliff’s servant, came in so
often to get flowers, that Kneller grew angry,
and sent word to the doctor that he felt obliged
to close up the gate. Ratcliff sent answer that he
could do with it what he pleased, only he would
not advise him to paint on it.</p>

<p>“Good,” said Kneller, “I’ll take anything
of his as long as it is not medicine.”</p>

<h3>Failed to Appreciate the Laugh</h3>

<p>When the celebrated Professor Gesenius announced
a lecture on the first book of Moses
(Genesis) his always well-filled auditorium was
crowded. All the students were waiting impatiently
for what was to come. Punctual to the
minute, Gesenius appeared, and opened his
lecture with these words: “Gentlemen, the
Genesis is not as old as you think.” This was
the signal for shouts of laughter from his entire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
audience, but which was not meant to offend
their honored lecturer, and we do not know
whether he ever heard the reason for this merriment.
Gesenius had five daughters, whom
the students designated by the names of the five
books of Moses—Genesis, Exodus, etc. The
oldest was Genesis. Hinc ille risus! (Hence
that laughter.)</p>

<h3>Crebillon’s Choice</h3>

<p>Crebillon was once asked why he chose the
terrifying for the subjects of his tragedies. “I
had no other choice left,” he replied. “Corneille
took Heaven from me; Racine the Earth
(world); so all that was left for me was Hades.”</p>

<h3>Absent-minded</h3>

<p>Neander, the great church historian, wanted
a book that was on top of a high book shelf in
his study. The step-ladder was not high
enough, so he climbed from that to the top of
the high, square porcelain stove to reach the
coveted treasure. He dived into it at once, and
grew so absorbed in the contents that he forgot
to come down from his perch. His sister,
Neander’s Hannchen, waited in vain for him to
come to the afternoon coffee. Anxiously she
hurried to the study but she did not discover<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
him. Seeing the step-ladder leaning against
the stove, and being of an orderly turn of mind,
she put it in its place. Concluding that her
brother must have gone out, she went back to
her room.</p>

<p>But when hour after hour went by, and evening
came, and Neander had not appeared, she
grew quite alarmed. What dreadful thing
might have happened to him! In the meantime
he—who was so painfully missed—found
that it was getting too dark on top of the stove
to read any longer, so he concluded to come
down from his high seat. But, alas! his retreat
was cut off! In a distressed voice he called
for his Hannchen, who delightedly hurried to
his relief.</p>

<h3>A Hard “Not”</h3>

<p>A young author once handed to Professor
Engel a drama, whose title was, “Such is Humanity,”
asking him to give his opinion of it.
Engel returned it shortly, saying: “I wrote my
opinion down on it.” The author for some
time looked in vain for the written criticism, but
at last he found that Engel had added to the
title the little word “not.”</p>

<h3>A Frank Answer</h3>

<p>Emperor Karl V, once asked Michel Angelo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
what he thought of Albrecht Dürer. The great
painter answered: “If I were not Michel
Angelo, I would rather be Albrecht Dürer than
Karl V.”</p>

<h3>Unbiased Opinion</h3>

<p>Count D., a collector and somewhat conceited
connoisseur of paintings, had a landscape in his
gallery which he considered a great masterpiece.
He showed it to a celebrated painter, asking his
opinion of it, with these words: “Several people
to whom I have shown it insist that it is a
copy, but I’m blessed if I don’t horsewhip the
next fellow who says so. Now, my dear friend,
I want you to give me your candid opinion of
it!”</p>

<h3>An Interesting Pose</h3>

<p>A young man wished to have his portrait
painted.</p>

<p>“How do you wish to pose?” asked the
artist.</p>

<p>“With a book in my hand, reading aloud.”</p>

<h3>Altruism</h3>

<p>A critic once boasted in company, of the
power of his pen, and said, among other bright
things, that artists owed their fame to him, as he
distributed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed you do,” replied a witty woman,
“and so generously, that there is not a particle
left for yourself.”</p>

<h3>Both May Be Mistaken</h3>

<p>Voltaire, while living at Berlin, once praised
the poet Haller very much. A gentleman present
said: “You praise Haller, while he expresses
himself very differently about you.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” returned Voltaire, “but
possibly we are both mistaken.”</p>

<h3>Very Slow</h3>

<p>“What,” cried a young physician, seeing
Voltaire drink coffee late at night, “you drink
coffee? Why, coffee is a slow poison!”</p>

<p>“I believe you are right there; it must be a
slow poison,” replied Voltaire, pouring out another
cup, “since I have enjoyed it daily, for
about sixty years.”</p>

<h3>Stars in the Wrong Places</h3>

<p>The great but timid astronomer, Schubert,
once acted very awkwardly at a court function.
Some one remarked how strange it was to see a
great man like that act so strangely. A wag
said sarcastically: “It, no doubt, confuses him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
to see so many stars in the wrong places,” referring
to the medals on the gentlemen’s breasts.</p>

<h3>All Score</h3>

<p>Gellert, the writer of a number of our most
beautiful hymns, wrote the following, of Haller’s
poem “The Origin of Evil”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I read The Origin of Evil, in our Haller’s works,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And determined, with some scores,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To mark all interesting places.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I read, I scored, read on, enjoyed it more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when I finished, lo, it was all—score.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Grillparzer and Hebbel</h3>

<p>It would be hard to find two more different
natures than those two authors and poets.
Hebbel was a giant, full of self-consciousness
and spiritual pride, classing himself with Shakespeare.
Grillparzer was simple, painfully modest
and retiring.</p>

<p>While both were at Vienna, Grillparzer was
invited to meet Hebbel, at an evening company,
which honor he declined with the following
words:</p>

<p>“I have a great respect for what he writes,
but, you see, I don’t feel at home near him.
I am truly afraid of him. He is too clever for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
me. He often starts queer subjects to converse
about. He is, for instance, fully capable of
asking you: ‘What is God?’ Well, I don’t
know, but he does. Now, since I cannot argue
with him, I should have to sit there like a
mute.”</p>

<h3>A Sad Waste</h3>

<p>Kästner once criticised a book like this:—“This
book is printed on the worst kind of
paper. What a pity to waste so much good
paper!”</p>

<h3>Slightly Misunderstood</h3>

<p>A stranger in München asked a gentleman
where the painter Kaulbach lived.</p>

<p>“Kaulbach? The painter Kaulbach?” said
he. “I don’t know the man, but if you need a
painter, I can recommend painter X. very
much; he painted my landlord’s doors and
windows very well and very cheap.”</p>

<h3>Gotthold Ephraim Lessing</h3>

<p>“Your book is full of donkey ears again,”
said his father to the little Lessing.</p>

<p>“Why father, that book has a perfect right
to donkey ears,” answered the future great
dramatist and critic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<h3>Forgot to Count the Money</h3>

<p>Lessing once had a servant, of whose honesty
he was warned repeatedly. For a long time he
paid no attention to this, but finally he concluded
to test the man. He told a friend that
he had left some money on the table, to see
whether their suspicions were well founded.
“But did you count how much you put
there?” asked the friend who knew Lessing’s
absent-mindedness. Lessing looked at him
startled; the need of counting it had never occurred
to him.</p>

<h3>Who He Was</h3>

<p>One day Lessing entered an inn and sat down
to write. The host came and asked him who
he was. Lessing, intent on his writing, did not
answer. Then the landlord came close to his
side, looked over his paper and asked again
harshly: “Who are you, sir; I wish to
know!” Lessing turned around and said very
seriously: “I am Lucas the Evangelist.” The
saint, be it remembered, is always painted with
an ox at his side.</p>

<h3>Called Him Names</h3>

<p>While Lessing was with Lichtenberg in Göttingen,
they talked one time about genius.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Lichtenberg said: “You are a genius!” To
which Lessing replied: “I feel tempted to
box the ears of anybody who calls me names
like that.”</p>

<h3>Absent-minded Men</h3>

<p>Theodor Mommsen, the genial historian,
when working, was oblivious to everything that
happened about him. Once he had a servant
who knew well how to take advantage of this.
He served his master’s dinner in the study, and
asked him to come to the table, but the professor
paid not the slightest attention to him. A
bright idea came to the man. He served the
second course, took away the first, and ate it
himself. He did the same with the second
and third courses.</p>

<p>A few hours later, the professor began to feel
the want of food, and going to the kitchen he
asked, angrily: “Am I not to have anything
to eat to-day?” “Why the professor has dined
long ago,” answers the servant unblushingly,
and Mommsen, cursing his absent-mindedness,
went back to his work again.</p>

<h3>Force of Habit</h3>

<p>There are absent-minded physicians too. The
physician of one of the princes was so busy, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
he never found time to take care of his own
health. Finally a virulent fever took hold of
him. Absent-mindedly he felt his own pulse
and muttered: “The fellow is lost; that comes
from the stupidity of people who never will call
in a doctor till it is too late.”</p>

<h3>Will Call Again</h3>

<p>The great Lessing too was often absent-minded
in the last years of his life. One evening
he knocked at his own house door. The
servant not recognizing him in the dark called
from a window: “The professor is not at
home.”</p>

<p>“All right, it does not matter,” returned
Lessing, “I’ll call again some other time.”</p>

<h3>Saphiriana</h3>

<p>(<i>How the great humorist came by his name.</i>)</p>

<p>Saphir’s grandfather’s name was Israel Israel.
Emperor Joseph ordered that all Jews should
take a permanent surname. Old Israel, when
summoned before the magistrate was very undecided,
so the man of law and justice, in order
to make short work of it, said: “You are
wearing a ring with a sapphire. Your name shall
be Saphir. That settles it. No contradicting
or——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>This “or” was accompanied by a certain
look at two policemen. So this “or” is the
cause of the humorist’s name.</p>

<h3>Lend and Forget</h3>

<p>Saphir was once asked by Baron Rothschild
to write something in his album. Saphir
wrote: “Lend me 100 Louis d’or and forget,
forever your friend,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">M. G. Saphir</span>.”<br>
</p>

<h3>Saphir’s Witty Reply</h3>

<p>An indifferent, but very arrogant author said
once:—“My works will be read when Schiller
and Goethe are long forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, not before that,” was Saphir’s
quick reply.</p>

<h3>Case Not Parallel</h3>

<p>Once an author came to Saphir with the
manuscript of a comedy he wished to read to
him, and said:—“You know, sir, that whenever
Molière finished one of his comedies, he
read it to an old woman in his service, thinking
that whatever would make her laugh, would
have the same effect on an audience. So in
reading mine to you, I have no doubt that if
it pleases you, it will please the public.”
“Thanks for your compliment, but since you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
are not Molière, permit me to decline to play
your old woman,” was Saphir’s reply.</p>

<h3>A Painter’s Stick</h3>

<p>Some one spoke of a clever young woman,
who had great talent for painting, and who had
recently married a fool. “If she does a great
deal of painting,” said Saphir, “I am not surprised
that she took a stick!”</p>

<h3>According to His Need</h3>

<p>Saphir once had a wordy battle with an author.
The latter, who envied the famous
humorist, said: “You write for money only,
while I write for honor.” “Every one of us
writes for what he needs most,” was Saphir’s
rejoinder.</p>

<h3>Heinrich Heine</h3>

<p>The first great wave of admiration brought to
Heine also a host of cavillers and doubters
of his genius.</p>

<p>Young Levin, brother of Rahel Varnhagen,
once told Heine, partly in fun, partly seriously,
that his poems particularly, did not deserve the
extravagant praise everybody bestowed on
them, and that their chief charm lay in the
quick transition from the highly pathetic to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
trivial, and that anybody who had caught the
trick could imitate them very easily.</p>

<p>“Well, compose a poem à la Heine,” said
the poet laughingly. “I am not afraid of your
competition.”</p>

<p>Next day his friend returned, handing him
the manuscript of a lyric poem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sie gab mir bei ihren Tode</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ein blasses, blaues Band—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Es liegt in meiner Commode</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Im Schube rechter hand.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">(“She gave me while dying</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A pale blue bow—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In my desk it is lying</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To this day, just so!”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This was what Heine read, and falling on his
friend’s neck in comical despair, cried:—“If
you publish that I am lost!” declaring himself
vanquished by this pretended take-off.</p>

<h3>To the End</h3>

<p>During the last days of his life, a friend
visited him at Paris, and entered just as two
nurses carried him to a fresh bed.</p>

<p>“How are you, Heinrich?” asked his friend.</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Heine; “you see the
women still carry me on their hands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<h3>Alexander von Humboldt</h3>

<p>When Humboldt was made honorary citizen
of Berlin, he made the customary visits of
thanks to all the city fathers. In his round he
came to the house of an elderly councilman,
who hurried down-stairs in his lounging robe
and received his distinguished guest at the carriage
door, with the explanation that he would
never permit the venerable gentleman to climb
the stairs in his behalf. At the same time,
he was not going to deny himself the honor of a
conversation. So he climbed into the carriage,
exchanged with Humboldt for a quarter of
an hour the usual courtesies, and ended his
visit by slipping back into his house, calling to
the coachman “to go on.”</p>

<h3>A Famous Climber</h3>

<p>While living at Paris, Heine’s apartments
were on the fifth floor. One day on returning
home, his wife met him at the door and told
him reproachfully that an old gentleman had
been there to see him; she was very sorry that
the poor old man had climbed all those stairs
for nothing. Heine looked at the visiting card.
“You may comfort yourself, dear child; that
man has climbed way above us.” It was the
card of Alexander von Humboldt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<h3>An Unexpected Find</h3>

<p>One afternoon Humboldt was walking through
one of the markets at Berlin, when his eye was
attracted to one of the stalls, where a pair
of beautiful pistols, inlaid with mother of pearl
and of rare old workmanship, were exhibited.
He bought them at the price of ten thalers, and
on his return home he made the interesting discovery
that one of the papers used for wrapping
was a leaf from an old “book on herbs,” the
work of one of the earliest printers. To save
from utter destruction a priceless treasure,
Humboldt returned at once into the region
of second-hand clothes-shops. For some time
he could not find the man who had sold him
the pistols, as all the dealers thought he had
come to return them. Only when he declared
that he had come to return a thaler given to
him above his change, they all came from their
shops, surrounded him and clamored for the
money. They grew so offensive that Humboldt
raised his pistols, which had the effect of making
them take to their heels and also brought
the real former owner, who told him to put the
old shooting irons in his pocket, as they were
not loaded, and to give him the money. Humboldt
followed him into his shop and asked for
the book from which the leaf was torn. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
soon discovered that with the exception of a
few leaves, the book bound in pigskin was
intact, and one of the rarest of its kind. Asked
for the price of the book, the dealer in old
clothes took a pair of patched trousers from
a hook and said:—“Give me four thalers and
you shall have this beautiful pair of trousers
into the bargain. You will look swell in them
next Sunday.” The bargain was closed, but
Humboldt declined the addition of old clothes.
Whenever the great naturalist afterwards showed
the treasures of his library to his friends, he
never omitted to tell the story of how he acquired
the “book on herbs.”</p>

<h3>Murder Will Out</h3>

<p>Having just recovered from a severe illness,
the amiable author of fairy tales, Musäus, was
invited out to a dinner. Everybody there was
pleased to see him looking so well, and congratulated
him on his recovery; but at last his wife
could keep silent no longer and confessed that
he only looked so well, because he had used
her rouge when dressing.</p>

<p>“Well, the murder is out,” said Musäus; “do
you feel better now? Yes, I did paint myself
red, because I dislike being pitied on account
of my illness, and would rather be envied for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
my healthy looks. But since my wife is such a
tell-tale, I shall not keep silent either, and will
tell you of a bright remark she made, a short time
ago, while we were driving to Erfurt. We were
passing a field of flax in full bloom and I said:
‘See how beautifully blue the flax is!’ At this
my wife points to the field next to it and says,
just to show her extraordinary knowledge of
farming: ‘Yes, but the <i>tow</i> in the next field
is looking fine too.’”</p>

<h3>Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi</h3>

<p>One day the great pedagogue was obliged to
borrow five hundred gulden from his friend, the
burgomaster of Aarau. On his way home to
Neuhof, he met a poor man, who told him that his
barn had burned down and that he had been to
Aarau to borrow the money to rebuild it, but
had met with no success. What was the philanthropist
to do! He gave the man the five hundred
gulden. Of course it was necessary to
return to his friend and borrow the same sum
over again, and also to ask him to look the
family up, but—now he came to think of it—he
had never even asked the man’s name.</p>

<h3>Taken for a Tramp</h3>

<p>Several times Pestalozzi, on account of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
negligent appearance, was taken for a tramp
and locked up, once at Bern, and later on at
Solothurn; at both places he was taken to the
hospital. At Bern, Baron von Fellenberg, to
whom he sent a note, hastened to the hospital
to explain the error made and secure his release.
Pestalozzi comforted his distressed friend by
telling him that he had had a very good bed
and an excellent soup. In Solothurn, they put
him in a room with a barred window, from
which, luckily, he saw the friend he was to visit,
and by calling to him, told him of his plight.
“But, for goodness’ sake, Pestalozzi, what did
they lock you up for?” asked his liberator.</p>

<p>“Oh well,” replied he, “they took me for a
fool or a rogue.”</p>

<h3>Caught for a Thief</h3>

<p>Another time Pestalozzi was caught by a guard,
just as he had climbed into an orchard and picked
up a fallen pear. The looks of the poorly
dressed stranger justified the man’s action, who
collared him and took him to the village lock-up
which was in the schoolhouse. As luck would
have it, the magistrate had read Pestalozzi’s
“Lienhart and Gertrud,” and set the author at
liberty with many excuses. On leaving the
great pedagogue said: “In future, do not lock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
up old rogues in your schoolhouse or you will
have young ones come from it.”</p>

<h3>His Awkwardness</h3>

<p>One day Pestalozzi was at a large dinner. He
wished to be gallant, and, on offering a dish to
his neighbor on the right, a lady dressed very
elaborately, emptied the contents of it over her
silk dress. To excuse himself he rose, and his
hasty movement caused his spur to catch in the
dress of his neighbor to the left, tearing it badly.
This was more than he could stand. With one
bound he rushed to the door, hurried down-stairs,
out to the stable, mounted his horse and
galloped off.</p>

<h3>Melanchthon’s Hobby</h3>

<p>Philipp Melanchthon’s hobby was palmistry.
One day he dined with one of Wittenberg’s
councilmen. The infant of the family was shown
to him, and Melanchthon was ready at once to
prove his skill. He took the tiny hand and said:
“This child will be a great theologian.”</p>

<p>“What a pity that it is a girl!” exclaimed
the father, while all present smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<h3>Invited Himself to Dinner</h3>

<p>Superintendent Lohmann once visited his
friend, the song writer, Pastor Hülsemann, of Elsey,
Westphalia. Lohmann finding the door open
entered the house. The parson was not in his
study, but down-stairs in the kitchen he heard
the parson’s wife. Lohmann, full of fun, as
usual, called down-stairs in his friend’s voice,
imitated to perfection: “Riekchen!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Lohmann, from Wesel, is here; see that we
have a good dinner.”</p>

<p>“What, is that slow old fellow here again?
I wish the idiot would stay at home!”</p>

<p>Lohmann said nothing, but went back to the
study. Soon after, his friend returned home and
was very glad to see his dear friend, the visitor.
Having no idea, of course, of what had happened,
he went down-stairs to tell his wife Riekchen,
that there would be a guest for dinner.
Entering the kitchen, he said: “Lohmann is
here.”</p>

<p>“You’ve told me that once before.”</p>

<p>“What! I told you? Why, I have only
just now entered the house.”</p>

<p>One can imagine the greetings at dinner when
the parties met; one rather embarrassed; the
other ready to burst with merriment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<h3>Sedan and Ses Dents</h3>

<p>Pius IX possessed a fondness for humor, even
when the occasion was a disagreeable one. When
the news was brought to him that the French
had lost Sedan, he cried: “Hélas, Napoleon a
perdu ses dents!” Napoleon has lost his
teeth (meaning, he will bite no more).</p>

<h3>The Rothschilds</h3>

<p>During the panic in the money market of
1866, the agent of a money-lending concern
came to Baron Rothschild and begged him to
advance them some money; but was promptly
refused.</p>

<p>“Oh, but you have always helped us before,”
wailed the agent.</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>“You lent us some money only a few days
ago.”</p>

<p>“That is true also.”</p>

<p>“Then, why do you refuse it now?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, the Jewish law forbids to
lend money to any one in extremity.”</p>

<h3>Wanted to Keep on Growing Old</h3>

<p>Frau Rothschild lived to be eighty-nine years
old, and, to the last, she retained not only her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
faculties, but also her much-dreaded wit. In
her last illness she whispered to her physician:
“Dear Doctor, do try to do something for me.”</p>

<p>“What can I do?” replied the physician, “I
can’t make you young again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to; I only want to keep
on growing old.”</p>

<h3>Risked Life for Wealth</h3>

<p>In 1820, the head of the house of Rothschild,
at Paris, was severely injured by a fall from his
horse. In order to save the wealthy man’s life
the celebrated surgeon, Dupuytren, was called
upon to perform a difficult and dangerous
operation.</p>

<p>The operation was successful, and was barely
finished, when a letter was brought to the surgeon,
who, on reading it, gave a cry of astonishment.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Rothschild, in a weak
voice.</p>

<p>“I must leave you at once!” cried Dupuytren;
“you will excuse me; the Duke de Berry
has just been assassinated at the opera!” With
these words he rushed off.</p>

<p>Against the surgeon’s order, Rothschild managed
to drag himself from his bed; reached, by
great exertion, the bell-rope; and rang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>Servants came running from all directions,
and he ordered them to send at once for his
bookkeeper, his cashier, his agents. Several appeared
within a few minutes. He cried: “Sell!
Sell everything, and at once!”</p>

<p>His prompt action saved his house from a
catastrophe, as stocks went way down. But his
imprudence made his recovery very slow, as it
confined him to his bed for weeks longer.</p>

<h3>Saved His New Hat</h3>

<p>The famous sculptor, Schadow, and Minister
von Schuckmann were both frequent visitors at
a Berlin club. The former always went home
early, while the minister was generally the last
to leave, and had his carriage call for him.</p>

<p>One evening the minister was the very last
one again, and found in the dressing-room only
one hat. Now his own hat was old and worn
and this one was brand new. There was nothing
to do—as he did not wish to drive home
bare-headed—but to wear the strange hat.
Although the rain was pouring down hard, it
would not hurt the hat in the carriage.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, while the minister
was still in bed, his footman brought him his
old hat and a note. It was from Schadow, saying:
“I bought a new hat yesterday morning.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
When I was leaving the club last night it rained
hard, and as I did not wish to spoil my new hat,
I took yours, knowing that your Excellency
would drive mine home unharmed.”</p>

<h3>No Great Art</h3>

<p>At a company, some one mentioned that a
famous Dutch painter could, with one stroke of
his brush, change a laughing child’s face into a
crying one. “Pshaw, that’s no great art; I
can do that with a broomstick!” was another’s
dry remark.</p>

<h3>Style Neutral</h3>

<p>A Jewish country merchant was in Frankfurt
on business, and decided to have a new suit
made while there. The tailor took his measure
and asked: “Do you wish the coat made English,
French, or German style?” “Make it
nice and modern, but quite neutral; I wish to
live with the whole world in peace,” was the
Jew’s reply.</p>

<h3>A Bit of Diplomacy</h3>

<p>A rich Jew asked a poor Jew to dinner. Fish
was served, and the rich man gave the poor
man the smallest. He picked at them with his
fork, without eating any, and mumbled the while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
in his beard. The rich man watched him for
some time, and then asked:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you eat? What are you doing
with the fishes?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said the other, “I was talking
to the fish.”</p>

<p>“Well, what about?”</p>

<p>“I had a brother who was drowned some
years ago, and we could not find him in the
water; so I was asking the fishes if they could
tell me something about him.”</p>

<p>“What do they say?”</p>

<p>“That they were still too small to know anything
about it; that I should ask the big ones.”</p>

<p>Ashamed, the rich man filled his plate with
large fish.</p>

<h3>No Cause for Weeping</h3>

<p>A Jew cried bitterly, when during the day of
atonement, the rabbi, chanting the psalm of penitence,
came to the place: “Dust thou art, to
dust thou shalt return.”</p>

<p>“Schmul, why dost thou weep?” asked his
neighbor, trying to comfort him. “If thou wert
gold, and had to turn to dust, thou would’st lose
one hundred per cent. But since thou art dust
and returnest to dust, thou gainest nothing and
losest nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<h3>Her Private Voice</h3>

<p>A wealthy Jewish society man, of Frankfurt,
sat one evening at the opera, in which a foreign
singer made her <i>début</i>. Next to him sat a lady
whom he knew slightly. He asked her very
soon, how she liked the singer, and to her favorable
comment said: “Oh, I have heard her sing
better; she dined at my house yesterday and sang
afterwards. Ah; if you could hear her beautiful
<i>private</i> voice!”</p>

<h3>A Candid Answer</h3>

<p>A young actor was playing Razman in Schiller’s
“Räuber” (Robbers). When he says to
Moor: “Come, let us go to the Bohemian forest
and gather a robber band,” Moor cries harshly:
“Fellow, who put these words into your mouth!”
The actor pointed at the prompter below, and
said timidly: “The fellow down there.”</p>

<h3>The Prelate and the Singer</h3>

<p>The following humorous incident is told in
verse of Prelate Carl von Gerok, the recently
deceased author of “Palm Leaves.” It happened
one spring-day in the King’s park at Stuttgart.
Along the philosopher’s path, Gerok was walking
deep in thought, and carrying an umbrella
very carefully in his hand. On a sidepath, never
thinking of a possible shower, walked a well-known
singer. Suddenly it began to sprinkle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
and in a few moments the rain came pouring
down. The prelate, a gallant gentleman, offered
to take the lady under his umbrella. Neither
one knew the other. In pleasant conversation
they arrived at the singer’s house, and Gerok
begged to know the lady’s name.</p>

<h3>Acute Hoarseness</h3>

<p>The singer Tichatschek was once engaged by
the Grand Duke of H. to sing for a few nights at
his Opera house. On arriving, the singer went
at once to an orchestra rehearsal of the opera in
which he was to sing, and which was conducted
by the Grand Duke, who was an enthusiastic
musician. While still behind the stage Tichatschek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
could hear that the orchestra was playing
out of tune and that the wind instruments were
ahead.</p>

<p>“Great heavens!” cried the singer, “what
musical chaos is this? What idiot is occupying
the leader’s desk?”</p>

<p>With these words he stepped upon the stage,
and found himself face to face with the Grand
Duke, who exclaimed excitedly:</p>

<p>“I am that idiot!”</p>

<p>The singer canceled his engagement on account
of “acute hoarseness.”</p>

<h3>Comforting Words</h3>

<p>A well-known comic actor, who had accumulated
a large fortune, was on his deathbed. A
number of his friends stood around, weeping.</p>

<p>“Calm yourselves,” said the dying man, “you
won’t weep over me as long as you have laughed
over me!”</p>

<h3>Forgot to Crow</h3>

<p>At a small theatre, Hamlet was being given,
and a very poor actor played the principal part.
In the scene with the ghost, he shouted like mad.
Some one in the parquet said: “Quite true to
Shakespeare, only the cock forgot to crow when
the ghost appeared.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>“Instead of that,” some one else said, “an
ass brayed.”</p>

<h3>Don’t Meddle</h3>

<p>A money lender once asked Garrick what he
understood by “honesty”?</p>

<p>“Why should you want to know,” replied
Garrick; “you had better not meddle with
things that don’t concern you!”</p>

<h3>Very Obliging</h3>

<p>When a third-rate actor, playing Hugo in
Müllner’s “Guilt,” stabbed himself, the audience
cried: “Bravo! da capo!” (do it
again). He jumped up, bowed, and stabbed
himself a second time.</p>

<h3>The Young Assyrian</h3>

<p>At the Karl Theatre in Vienna the farce “Judith
and Holofernes” was being played. During
the performance a small dog that had been
hiding behind the scenes walked out on the
stage, stood still in front of Holofernes and
wagged his tail. Nestroy, who was playing
that part, had hardly spied the uninvited guest,
when he cried pathetically:</p>

<p>“What does this young Assyrian here?”</p>

<p>The audience broke into a roar of laughter
and applause, while the young Assyrian fled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<h3>Nature, not Art</h3>

<p>A singer, whose simple, soulful singing more
than compensated for the usual flourishes of so-called
high art, was playing <i>Julia</i> in “The
Vestalin.”</p>

<p>“Is this art?” asked the resident <i>prima
donna</i>, of the manager.</p>

<p>“God forbid!” replied he, with a sarcastic
smile, “this is pure, true nature.”</p>

<h3>The Methodist’s View</h3>

<p>A Methodist once said of a theatre: “It is
a place where Satan can have, every evening, so
many souls for a few pieces of silver, that he
is sorry he once bribed Judas Iscariot with
thirty pieces.”</p>

<h3>Asking His Pardon</h3>

<p>While Beckmann, the great comic actor, was
playing at Berlin, his friends persuaded him
one day to imitate Fränkel, the journalist and
critic. He did it both in looks and manners so
well, that at the close of the act the audience
called for Fränkel. The offended critic brought
suit, and Beckmann was sentenced to ask the
complainant’s pardon, in the presence of witnesses
and at the plaintiff’s home. At the appointed
hour Fränkel, surrounded by his family<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
and a number of friends, was waiting for the
penitent. Time passed on leaden feet. At last
the door opened, Beckmann put his head in
and asked:</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Maier live here?”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” replied Fränkel, “he lives next
door.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then, I beg your pardon!” said Beckmann,
who, having thus done penance, retreated
quickly, amidst shouts of laughter from all but
the angry, disappointed Fränkel.</p>

<h3>Peter and the Cock</h3>

<p>A manager whose name was Peter, engaged
a singer, named Cock for a number of operas.
At the first performance, the singer did not
please. Things were worse at the second; and
on the third night the house was empty. A
critic said:</p>

<p>“When the cock crew the third time, Peter
went out and wept bitterly.”</p>

<h3>The Actor’s Generosity</h3>

<p>A great comic actor had been assisting at a
concert, given for the benefit of the poor of a
large parish. After the concert the clergyman
entertained at supper all who had taken part.
The great actor found under his napkin an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
easter egg, and on breaking it, five gold pieces
fell out.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said merrily, to his host, “you
knew that I am fond of boiled eggs, but one
thing you did not know, that I eat only the
white. Permit me to leave the yolk for your
poor.”</p>

<h3>Art and Artist</h3>

<p>On the same day a mediocre actor and a
frivolous spendthrift died at Berlin. Some one
remarked: “The city has lost to-day two artists
of a peculiar kind: the one still owes us art,
the other had the art to owe us!”</p>

<h3>The Horse-Thief</h3>

<p>One day a famous actor, who was seeking his
health in the country, missed his horse. He
asked a countryman whether there were horse-thieves
around.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said he, “we are all honest people
here; but for some days, some actor-fellow from
the city has been loafing around here; perhaps
he took it.”</p>

<h3>Truth and Fiction</h3>

<p>A bishop once asked a great actor:</p>

<p>“How is it, that we clergymen, in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
the great and true subjects we discuss in public,
make so little impression, while you gentlemen
of the stage, make so much?”</p>

<p>“It is because we actors make fiction sound
like truth, while you clergymen make truth
sound like fiction.”</p>

<i>The German Soldier</i></h2>

</div>

<h3>The Greater Misfortune</h3>

<p>“The enemies of our military system,” said
an examining officer, “say that a standing army
is a great misfortune. Can you tell me of a
still greater one?”</p>

<p>“One that is running away,” was the quick
rejoinder.</p>

<h3>Sitting and Standing</h3>

<p>A soldier who was supposed to stand guard
at the entrance of a public building, had sat
down on a large stone in front of it. An officer,
in passing, asked him angrily: “What are you
doing?”</p>

<p>“I am sitting here standing guard.”</p>

<h3>The Soldier’s Requisites</h3>

<p>Lieutenant:—“What should every true soldier
have?”</p>

<p>Recruit:—“Three sweethearts—a cook, a
barmaid, and a laundress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<h3>Diplomatic</h3>

<p>Colonel:—“I do not see, Lieutenant, what
there is to laugh at, in the serious words I am
addressing to you.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant (who has noticed that all the other
officers present are watching him):—“If the
Colonel will pardon me I will tell him. If I
make a sober face, my comrades present will
think I am being hauled over the coals; but
seeing me smile, they will think you are inviting
me to your dinner-party to-night.”</p>

<h3>The Recruit’s Use for His Head</h3>

<p>“You, fellow!” called a Sergeant to a recruit,
“you are not paying attention! What is
your head for?”</p>

<p>“That my necktie can’t slip off.”</p>

<h3>An Unconscious Repetition</h3>

<p>Colonel:—“I am sorry to have to tell you,
but the Sergeant has lodged a complaint against
you. You called him an ass.”</p>

<p>Captain of the Horse:—“Pardon me, Colonel;
I am sometimes a little rough. I am
really sorry to have used the expression, but I
should never have thought that the man was
such an ass as to be offended.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<h3>A Queer Way of Reckoning</h3>

<p>Corporal:—“Captain, I have to report that
three men are missing.”</p>

<p>Captain:—“Why, how is that?”</p>

<p>Corporal:—“There are three sausages too
many.”</p>

<h3>The Standing Army</h3>

<p>“Will you not sit down by me, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, madam, but I
belong to the standing army.”</p>

<h3>The Odd Pair of Boots</h3>

<p>“Why John, what a stupid action this is,”
said a Captain of the Horse, to his servant.
“You have brought me a pair of boots that do
not match. One has a high top and the other
a low one.”</p>

<p>“I have been wondering about that myself,
and I don’t understand it,” said the man, “but
the most curious part of it is, that on the shoe-box
stands another pair just like this one.”</p>

<h3>The Jew’s Reasoning</h3>

<p>An officer fell from his horse in a public
square. A Jew standing near said: “This
would never have happened to me, sir!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>“What, Jew, are you a better rider than I?”</p>

<p>“Not that,” replied the Jew, “but I should
never have mounted the horse.”</p>

<h3>Dense Stupidity</h3>

<p>Sergeant (to a recruit):—“You idiot, you
are so stupid that Schwarz could not have invented
the gunpowder, if you had been within
forty miles of him.”</p>

<h3>Proved</h3>

<p>An intoxicated soldier, who was quarreling
with his Corporal finally said:</p>

<p>“You just keep quiet; you are no man.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you,” retorted the Corporal, drawing
his sabre.</p>

<p>“You can’t do it,” returned the other;
“does not the Captain always say, when he
orders out the guard: ‘for this post, six men
and a corporal’? Do you see now that a
Corporal isn’t called a man?”</p>

<h3>No Swearing on Sunday</h3>

<p>Captain:—“To-day is Sunday, so I won’t
swear; but to-morrow, you may all go to
thunder!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<h3>Guarding the Sentry-box</h3>

<p>A recruit stood sentry for the first time. At
first he walked quietly up and down before the
sentry-box. After a while he grew tired, stood
still before it, looked it all over and shaking his
head exclaimed: “I wonder what they see in
this old box that I must stand here and guard
it!”</p>

<h3>On the Parade-ground</h3>

<p>A squadron of cavalry was drilling for a review,
which was to be held shortly. The
Prince, riding past, looked on. An attack was
executed which closed with a jump across a
ditch. One rider fell with his horse and rolled
into the ditch. The Prince rode up, asked the
man if he was hurt, gave him a ten mark piece,
and rode slowly away.</p>

<p>“Sergeant,” called the Captain, “give that
fellow three days in the guard-house!”</p>

<p>Hearing this, the Prince rode up to the Captain
and said:</p>

<p>“Could not you let the poor devil off for
once?”</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” returned the Captain
frankly, “if you give to every soldier who falls,
a ten mark piece, my whole squadron will be in
the ditch to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<h3>An Important Question</h3>

<p>Officer’s servant:—“Excuse me, sir; have
you an advertisement in the paper, that on account
of sickness a horse will be sold?”</p>

<p>Gentleman:—“I have.”</p>

<p>Servant:—“Then my Captain wishes to know
whether the gentleman is sick or the horse?”</p>

<h3>The Listening Angels</h3>

<p>Captain (noticing that after his command
“stand still” two soldiers are whispering):—“When
I, your Captain, command, ‘stand
still,’ the angels in heaven listen; but you, you
lobsters, can’t keep your tongues still.”</p>

<h3>Only Two Straws</h3>

<p>Captain of the horse (discovering two straws
on the race-track):—“Lieutenant A., who
ordered a hurdle-race for to-day?”</p>

<h3>Marrying for Love</h3>

<p>1st Lieutenant:—“Comrade, I am a happy
mortal. Engaged to be married. Loveliest
girl,—an angel I tell you. Marry for love—upon
honor!”</p>

<p>2d Lieutenant:—“Has she money?”</p>

<p>1st Lieutenant:—“What a stupid question!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<h3>His Own Handkerchief</h3>

<p>Lieutenant (to his orderly):—“You idiot,
what are you thinking of, to clean my drinking
cup with a handkerchief?”</p>

<p>Servant:—“Beg your pardon, sir, but it is
my own.”</p>

<h3>The Cold Ice</h3>

<p>“Pray, tell me, Captain, why you are staring
so hard at my plate?”</p>

<p>“I am admiring that ice, Fräulein, that can
keep so cold in view of your charms.”</p>

<h3>A Charitable Institution</h3>

<p>“Have not seen you for a long time, Count.
Been on leave?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,—been two weeks in Potsdam.
Aunt died suddenly.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,—congratulations. Inherit anything?”</p>

<p>“Not I; the old aunt left everything to
charitable institutions. Stupid idea! As if a
German Officer of the Guard was not a charitable
institution, too!”</p>

<h3>An Unexpected Answer</h3>

<p>Sergeant (instructing):—“Who commands a
battalion?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>(Soldier is silent. Behind him some one
whispering.)</p>

<p>Sergeant:—“What blockhead is whispering
to you?”</p>

<p>Soldier:—“The Major.”</p>

<h3>Saved His Honor</h3>

<p>“Where is the sausage that you were to
bring every evening?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Lieutenant; I ate it myself.”</p>

<p>“What! how dare you?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, sir, coming back with it, I
met a comrade, and he asked me to whom the
sausage belonged, and I said, of course, ‘To
my master.’</p>

<p>“‘What,’ said he, sneeringly, ‘does your
master eat only a sausage for supper? What a
shame!’ So I told him you bought it for me,
and ate it up right before him and so took the
shame upon myself.”</p>

<h3>It Depends</h3>

<p>Lieutenant (to recruit):—“How should a
soldier act before the enemy?”</p>

<p>Recruit:—“That depends entirely upon how
the enemy acts!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<h3>More True Than Kind</h3>

<p>Major’s Wife (stout and elderly):—“Lieutenant
von Schwenker is a charming man. At
every ball he comes to me and begs for the first
dance.”</p>

<p>Colonel:—“He is all right; he is a brave
fellow, that Lieutenant; he always does the
disagreeable duties first.”</p>

<h3>An Appropriate Gift</h3>

<p>A general who had the misfortune to lose
several battles, received as a New Year’s
present a box containing a drum on which was
written: “Not good for anything but to be
beaten.”</p>

<h3>Thankful For Anything</h3>

<p>Lieutenant:—“You idiot; you have brought
me a single ticket instead of a return ticket!”</p>

<p>Servant:—“But sir, there was such a crowd
at the ticket-office, that I was glad to get this
one.”</p>

<h3>The Lost Colonel</h3>

<p>Youthful Prince (as guest at a drill, sees the
Colonel lead his regiment in a poorly executed
attack):—“General, that regiment I suppose is
lost?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>General:—“The regiment is not, your Highness,
but the Colonel is!”</p>

<h3>Too Cautious</h3>

<p>“George, you must always knock at the
door before you enter a room, and then wait
until some one calls ‘come in,’” said the
Major’s wife to a new servant. While the Major
and his wife are at dinner, George puts his
head through a crack in the door, but draws it
back quickly, closes the door, and knocks.
His astonished mistress calls: “Come in!...
George, did you not understand? I told
you to knock first, and then wait until some
one calls ‘come in.’ Instead of doing that,
you looked first into the room. What did you
mean by that?”</p>

<p>“I understood you all right, but I had
to look in first to see if any one was in the room
to call ‘come in.’”</p>

<h3>A Pertinent Question</h3>

<p>Corporal:—“Recruit Neier, how many more
times must I tell you to hold your head up!
What makes you look at the grass all the time;
haven’t you had your breakfast yet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<h3>Subordination</h3>

<p>Major (narrating):—“But when, on the
thirteenth of October, the battle of Leipzig was
fought——”</p>

<p>Lieutenant:—“Excuse me, Major; that was
on the eighteenth.”</p>

<p>Major:—“Young man, do you think you
know it better than I? I tell you it was on the
thirteenth.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant:—“I do know it was not, for
only lately I read the history of the battle by a
famous historian.”</p>

<p>Major:—“Don’t talk to me about any
of your scribblers. I—your Major—tell you it
was on the thirteenth.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant:—“Pardon me, Major, if I
doubt it in spite of that.”</p>

<p>Major (boiling with rage):—“Very well,
Lieutenant, then I tell you <i>officially</i>, that it was
on the thirteenth.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant:—“Very well, Major, then it
<i>was</i> on the thirteenth.”</p>

<h3>Modest</h3>

<p>The Lieutenant wishes to give to a reporting
soldier a cigar, and opens a fresh box.</p>

<p>Soldier:—“Oh don’t trouble about opening
the box, sir; I can do that at home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<h3>Poison in It</h3>

<p>Captain:—“John, go up-stairs and ask my
wife to give you my field-flask; but don’t you
drink out of it. I believe there is poison in it.”</p>

<p>John (in the Captain’s rooms):—“Will
the gracious Frau kindly give me the Captain’s
field-flask?”</p>

<p>Captain’s Wife:—“Which is the one he
wants? There are several hanging here.”</p>

<p>John:—“The one which the Captain believes
has poison in it.”</p>

<h3>Nothing Else to Do</h3>

<p>Sergeant:—“A sentry may not leave his
post under any circumstances. Recruit Huber,
what would you do if you stood guard at the
powder magazine, and there should be an explosion
and the whole thing flew into the air?”</p>

<p>Huber:—“Fly with it.”</p>

<h3>His Size</h3>

<p>“Marie, why did you make the potato dumplings
so dreadfully large?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, madam, that my sweetheart
is in the Artillery, and he is used to this
size.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<h3>He Forgot Himself</h3>

<p>Captain of the Cavalry (playing a duet):—“But
my dear lady, you are again a nose-length
ahead of me!”</p>

<h3>A Strenuous Captain</h3>

<p>Lady:—“Please, Captain, play my accompaniment
on the piano.”</p>

<p>Captain:—“With great pleasure! I’ll follow
you through thick and thin on that piano.”</p>

<h3>Not Very Clear</h3>

<p>Sergeant (at instruction):—“Muller, what
is horizontal?”</p>

<p>Soldier:—“If from the centre of the
earth——”</p>

<p>Sergeant:—“Never you mind the centre of
the earth; I asked you what horizontal is.”</p>

<p>Soldier:—“Every plain——”</p>

<p>Sergeant:—“Oh pshaw! Now listen! four
equally high feet, a couple of boards across
them—that’s horizontal.”</p>

<h3>Never Deserts</h3>

<p>“May I offer you some dessert, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Thank you—but a Lieutenant never deserts!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<h3>One Thing Forgotten</h3>

<p>Corporal (to his men, with whose drilling the
Colonel has just found fault):—“I tell you this
much, you fellows, if you don’t do any better,
we shall drill the whole day, have field practice
at night, bivouac afterwards, without fire, without
straw, without cooking, and with the thermometer
ten degrees below zero.”</p>

<p>A voice from the ranks:—“Why don’t you
let it rain too!”</p>

<h3>Rather Mixed</h3>

<p>Ten minutes after taps:—“Oh say! don’t run
so hard. We’ll get there early enough to be—too
late.”</p>

<h3>Disagreeable</h3>

<p>Lieutenant:—“I saw you running after a girl
last night. It was after ten o’clock, and she was
a homely, old piece at that. You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.”</p>

<p>Soldier:—“Your pardon, Lieutenant, but—I
was ordered to take—the Colonel’s wife home
from the theatre.”</p>

<h3>At the Swimming School</h3>

<p>Sergeant (to a recruit):—“You big num-skull,
you are more stupid than a piece of wood!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
That, at any rate can swim, and that is a good
deal more than you can do!”</p>

<h3>A Cunning Sergeant</h3>

<p>In the barrack yard of a garrison stood a lot
of pear trees. The pears were ripe and a squad
of soldiers under the supervision of Sergeant
Schulze, is ordered to gather them. Punctually
at the appointed hour the men arrive, and,
shortly after, have disappeared among the
branches of the trees to begin their task. Sergeant
Schulze soon notices that more pears go
into the men’s pockets than into the baskets.
However he says nothing and looks on smilingly.
As soon as all the fruit is gathered, he orders the
men to the horizontal bars standing in the yard,
whereupon there is a great shower of pears from
the men’s pockets.</p>

<h3>Fault of the Target</h3>

<p>Captain:—“What were the results of your
target-practice?”</p>

<p>Sergeant:—“Good, Captain; my men would
have shot better if the target had stood a little
more to the right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<h3>Couldn’t Ride</h3>

<p>Corporal:—“Goodness me! that fellow wabbles
around on his horse, like a poet on Pegasus!”</p>

<h3>The Horse’s Grudge</h3>

<p>“There is that fellow fallen off again! That
is about the tenth time to-day!”</p>

<p>“Corporal, I believe that horse has a grudge
against me.”</p>

<h3>Condescension</h3>

<p>Recruit (lying on the ground):—“Captain, I
won’t sit that horse again; he is too uppish.
Just see him look down on me!”</p>

<h3>Bivouac Punch</h3>

<p>Captain:—“What in the name of common
sense, is the matter with this punch? It tastes
abominable! Schaffer, what kind of water did
you use when you made it?”</p>

<p>Schaffer:—“It was quite fresh from the village,
sir, but as you said you did not need it for
an hour and it was boiling, I cooked the sausages
in it.”</p>

<h3>It Depends on His Looks</h3>

<p>Lieutenant:—“Mayer, suppose you are standing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
sentry, and an officer, wearing his cloak
comes along, you cannot tell whether it is a
General or a Captain; what salute would you
make?”</p>

<p>Mayer:—“If he looks pleasant I would
‘shoulder arms,’ but if he looks gruff, I had better
‘present arms.’”</p>

<h3>Too Far Away</h3>

<p>Sergeant:—“Recruit Berger, you were ten
minutes late again last night; where were you?”</p>

<p>Berger:—“I—I—was with my sweetheart,
and she lives so far away—that——”</p>

<p>Sergeant:—“How many times must you fellows
be told that discipline does not bother with
love affairs! If you must fall in love, do it near
the barracks.”</p>

<h3>For His Helmet’s Sake</h3>

<p>Sergeant:—“Why must a soldier never lose
his head?”</p>

<p>Recruit:—“Because—because—he could
never put his helmet on again.”</p>

<h3>A Good Shot</h3>

<p>A recruit, who was standing guard one night
near an observatory, was staring thoughtlessly at
the sky and up at the tower. Suddenly somebody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
appeared on the observatory, and, as the
recruit thought, pointed with a long gun into the
night. “Now I should just like to know what
that man up there wants to shoot in the dark,”
he said to himself, while his eyes followed the
direction of the telescope. All at once a star
fell. The gun dropped from the astonished recruit’s
hand as he cried: “Well, I’ll be jiggered;
he hit it!”</p>

<h3>Remedy for Don Juans</h3>

<p>General:—“Were you at my house?”</p>

<p>Adjutant:—“Yes, sir; your gracious wife is
at home, and Lieutenant von Schneidewitz is
there.”</p>

<p>General:—“Again? Have an alarm sounded
at once.”</p>

<h3>No Money, No Gun</h3>

<p>Markgraf Johann von Brandenburg,
reigning Prince of Neumark, was in the habit
of leaving his debts stand for a long time. His
gunsmith at Nuremberg was well aware of this.
So having filled an order, he wrote one day the
following laconic letter to him;</p>

<p>“Good-day, your Grace! Your gun is
finished. If you send the money, I’ll send you
the gun. If you don’t send the money, you
won’t get the gun. God be with you!”</p>

<p>His Grace, far from resenting this language,
sent the money.</p>

<h3>The Living and Not the Dead</h3>

<p>Emperor Joseph II of Austria, was once
asked by an ecclesiastic of noble birth, for permission
to go to Rome, to visit the graves of the
Apostles Peter and Paul. The Emperor made
this very appropriate answer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>“It would be more agreeable to me, if, instead
of making a pilgrimage to dead bones, you
would visit more in your parish. I am sure the
Apostle Princes would be more pleased with
that, too.”</p>

<h3>Good Advice</h3>

<p>On one occasion Emperor Joseph II returned
the poems of a very indifferent poetess whose
name was Kemeter, with this marginal note:
“My dear Kemeter, you had better make
hemeter” (shirts).</p>

<h3>The Unusual Postilion</h3>

<p>Emperor Joseph II traveled under the name
of Count von Falkenburg. Once, when passing
through Stuttgart, the Duke of Würtemberg
offered to him the use of the castle, but the
Emperor declined, saying he would rather go
quietly to a hotel. Then the Duke ordered all
hotelkeepers of Stuttgart to take down their
signs and had an immense one put over the
castlegate which bore these words: “Hotel
Emperor Joseph II.”</p>

<p>Such an invitation the Emperor could not resist.
When he descended from his carriage,
the Duke received him, dressed as a hotelkeeper,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
while members of the highest nobility
played the parts of servants. The most beautiful
ladies, in cap and apron acted as chambermaids,
some noblemen as waiters. The Emperor
entered into the joke heartily, and it was
carried on through the day in the most charming
manner. His going was as remarkable as his
coming. When the coach drove up, a postilion
mounted the horse. His shabby coat and dirty
boots drew the Emperor’s attention.</p>

<p>“This fellow,” he said, laughing, “is certainly
no flatterer; he did not even put on his
Sunday coat. He looks as if he liked a drink;
we must give him a good tip.”</p>

<p>But the postilion drove with great skill, and
very fast. When they reached the first station
his Majesty was going to give him a good tip
but was told that it was the Prince —— who
had driven him in his own coach. The Emperor
thanking him said: “You made a
splendid postilion, but if I had watched you, I
should have discovered the fraud, for now I
think of it, you did not swear once.”</p>

<h3>The Fourth Vow</h3>

<p>A knight of the Maltese Cross, once boasted
before Emperor Leopold II: “We took three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
vows, that of poverty, of chastity, and of obedience.”</p>

<p>“As far as I know,” returned the Emperor,
“you made a fourth one,—that, of not intending
to keep any of the three.”</p>

<h3>The Two Exceptions</h3>

<p>A quick, witty answer always won the heart
of Frederick William I. Once, on horseback,
he turned a street corner, and found himself so
close to a young man that his horse’s nose
touched the latter’s breast.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he asked harshly.</p>

<p>“A Candidatus Theologiæ, your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“Where from?”</p>

<p>“From Berlin.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, the Berliners don’t amount to anything.”</p>

<p>“The majority certainly do not, your Majesty,
but there are exceptions. I know of two.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty and—myself.”</p>

<p>This was a man after the King’s own heart,
unafraid, quick-witted. It was not long before
he had a good parish.</p>

<h3>The Empty Upper Story</h3>

<p>King Frederick William I after an audience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
with an Ambassador, said to his equerry, who
was present:</p>

<p>“Isn’t he a tall, handsome man? What do
you think of his head?”</p>

<p>“Tall, handsome people, like the Ambassador,
your Majesty, resemble houses four or five
stories high. The first three or four stories are
generally occupied, but the upper story is
empty.”</p>

<h3>An Effectual Cure</h3>

<p>While Prince von Lobkowitz was Emperor
Leopold’s minister of state, at the beginning of
the eighteenth century, the streets of the Austrian
capital were in a dreadful condition.
Lobkowitz had asked the city officials repeatedly
to see that the streets were kept clean, but without
avail. Then the Prince, in his capacity as
Governor of Vienna, sent for the burgomaster,
who arrived in his embroidered court dress, low
shoes, and silk stockings. The Prince received
him pleasantly, but seemed very busy.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he began, “but urgent
business calls me away; come with me in my
carriage and we will discuss affairs on the way.
I will put you down in your street, so you can
send your own carriage home.”</p>

<p>The very much flattered and elated burgomaster<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
did so, and took his seat beside the
Prince, who began to talk about the weather.</p>

<p>Suddenly the minister looked around as if
frightened.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said in a tone of deep regret, just
as the carriage was going through one of the
filthiest streets of the city, “I have mistaken
my way. I must ask you to descend here, as
my business calls me to the other side of the
city, and I am late already.”</p>

<p>The footman opened the carriage door, but
when the burgomaster saw the sea of mud into
which he was to step, he turned to the Prince
and begged to be taken a little further.</p>

<p>“Impossible,” said Lobkowitz, firmly. So
the poor burgomaster, in his court finery, had
to step out into the mud into which he sank
ankle deep. Lobkowitz laughed aloud. But
he never had to complain of dirty streets again.</p>

<h3>Punished by Proxy</h3>

<p>A basket of fine cherries having been sent to
Frederick the Great, at a time when that fruit
was extremely scarce, he sent them by one of his
pages to the Queen. The page, tempted by the
beauty of the fruit, could not resist tasting, and
finding them delicious, devoured them all,
without reflecting on the consequences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>A few days afterwards Frederick asked the
Queen how she had liked the cherries.</p>

<p>“Cherries?” said the Queen, “what cherries?”</p>

<p>“Why, did not Clist, the page, bring you a
basket the other day?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied her majesty, “I have not seen
any.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the King, “I will give that rogue
something more savory.”</p>

<p>He then went to his room and wrote the following
note to the officer of the royal guard.</p>

<p>“Give the bearer twenty-five lashes, and take
his receipt for them.”</p>

<p>He then called Clist, and told him to take the
note to the guard-house and wait for an answer.</p>

<p>The page, however, fearing something wrong,
determined to send the note by somebody else,
and just as he was going out at the palace door,
he met a Jew banker who was well-known at
court, and asked him to carry the King’s note.
The Jew, glad of an opportunity to be obliging,
went at once. On his arrival at the guard-house,
the officer read the note, told the messenger to
wait, and called out the guard. The Jew, thinking
it was to do him honor as a messenger from
court, begged the officer not to give himself any
trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>“I will not,” he replied, and ordered the
guard to seize the Jew, and give him twenty-five
lashes, which was immediately done. The Jew,
with his honor and his back severely wounded,
was going away; but the officer told him he
could not go till he had given a written acknowledgment
for what he had received. The Jew
was obliged to give it for fear of getting another
beating.</p>

<p>The affair soon came to the ears of the King,
who, though he could not help laughing heartily
at the adventure, was obliged to confer some
favors on the hero of it, as the banker frequently
advanced him large sums of money, in cases of
necessity.</p>

<h3>Did Not Stammer When Singing</h3>

<p>Frederick the Great once gave an audience to
a man who stammered. This grew very tiresome
to his Majesty, who asked:</p>

<p>“Tell me, do you stammer when you sing?”</p>

<p>“No—your—Majesty!”</p>

<p>“Well then, just sing to me, what you wish to
tell me.”</p>

<h3>Without Mercy</h3>

<p>“Well, I made one parson happy, for this
world and the next,” Frederick the Great often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
said laughing heartily. “It was in Silesia. I
had been quartered several times at the village
parson’s without ever having seen him, so I sent
for him.</p>

<p>“‘How do you do, parson?’</p>

<p>“‘Very badly.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, Well! Have patience; everything
will be all right in the next world.’</p>

<p>“‘I doubt it very much; I am afraid it will
be worse.’</p>

<p>“‘How so?’</p>

<p>“‘I have two daughters, three sons, a small
parish and—debts. If I die, without having
satisfied my creditors, your Majesty will understand
that I should be damned without mercy.’”</p>

<h3>He Did Not Understand</h3>

<p>Frederick the Great made the personal acquaintance
of every soldier of his regiment of
guards. Whenever he saw a fresh one, he put
the three following questions to him: “First,
how old are you? Second, how long have you
been in my service? Third, are you satisfied
with your pay and treatment?”</p>

<p>It happened that a young Frenchman, who
did not understand German, enlisted in the
Prussian service, and Frederick, on seeing him,
put the usual questions. The soldier had learned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
the answers by heart, but in the same order as
the King generally interrogated.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, on this occasion, the King
began with the second question:</p>

<p>“How long have you been in my service?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-one years,” replied the Frenchman.</p>

<p>“What!” said Frederick, “how old are you
then?”</p>

<p>“One year,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Upon my word,” exclaimed his majesty,
“you or I must be mad!”</p>

<p>“Both,” replied the soldier, according to
what he had been taught.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the astonished King, “this is
the first time I have ever been called a madman
by one of my guards. What do you mean by it,
sir?”</p>

<p>The poor fellow seeing that the King was angry,
told him, in French, that he did not understand
a word of German.</p>

<p>“Oh! is that so?” said the monarch.
“Well, learn it as soon as possible, and I have
no doubt that you will make a very good soldier.”</p>

<h3>In His Majesty’s Service</h3>

<p>Some time after having sustained a severe defeat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
at Kolin, Frederick the Great, at a review,
jokingly asked a soldier, who had a deep cut in
his cheek:</p>

<p>“Friend, at what ale-house did you get that
scratch?”</p>

<p>“I got it,” said the soldier, “at Kolin, where
your Majesty paid the reckoning.”</p>

<h3>The King Would Run Too</h3>

<p>Just before the battle of Rosbach (1757),
things looked bad for the King. Frederick the
Great was lying asleep on a heap of straw near a
camp-fire, when he was awakened by one of his
grenadiers calling:</p>

<p>“Frederick!” (The grenadiers of his guard
were allowed to call him that.) “Look, they
are bringing in one of your grenadiers who has
deserted!”</p>

<p>“Why did you run away and leave your
King?” was Frederick’s question.</p>

<p>“Well, things were going so badly with you,
that I wanted to try my luck elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” concluded the King; “but
just try one more campaign, and if things don’t
look any better for me after that, I’ll promise
you, I will run away with you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<h3>Would Declare War</h3>

<p>If Frederick the Great heard that any one
had spoken ill of him, he simply asked:</p>

<p>“Does the fellow own a hundred thousand
men?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I can’t do anything to him;
but if he commanded a hundred thousand soldiers
I would declare war on him.”</p>

<h3>The Snuff Box of Frederick the Great</h3>

<p>One time Frederick the Great presented to
Count von Schwerin, his equerry, a snuff-box
with a monkey on the lid. The Count had the
monkey taken out and the king’s picture put in
the place. In the evening, looking as pleased
as possible, he paraded it before the king’s eyes.</p>

<p>“You seem to like it,” said the king, with
an ironic smile.</p>

<p>“Everything that comes from your Majesty’s
hands is precious to me,” Schwerin assured
him, “and I value this box the more, as it
shows the picture of one whom I honor with all
my heart—your Majesty’s picture!” Astounded
at this impudence, Frederick looked at
the box, and, noticing the change, laughed at
the old diplomat and said:</p>

<p>“The idea is fine and does you honor, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
picture is not good; here is a better one!” and
handed him his own richly-jeweled snuff-box.</p>

<h3>The Bishop’s Cloak</h3>

<p>One of the characteristics of Frederick the
Great was that he loved a tilt with the clergy.
So he said to the Bishop of Ermenland:</p>

<p>“I hope to slip into paradise under your
cloak.”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” returned the Bishop, whose income
had been reduced to one-third, “your
Majesty has cut down my cloak too much.”</p>

<h3>Deserved His Rest</h3>

<p>General Ziethen once fell into a doze at the
king’s table. As some one made a motion
to rouse him, the king said:</p>

<p>“Let him sleep. He has watched long
enough that we might rest.”</p>

<h3>Thoughtfulness for Others</h3>

<p>During the many wars he was engaged in,
Frederick the Great shared not only all the
dangers but also all the hardships of the common
soldier.</p>

<p>Once he marched with his grenadiers till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
very late at night. At last they halted, and the
king said:</p>

<p>“Grenadiers, it is a very cold night; we
must have a fire!” One was built at once.
Frederick wrapped himself in his cloak, sat
down on a few pieces of wood near the fire, and
the soldiers grouped themselves around him.
After a while General Ziethen came, and he
also sat down on a little pile of wood. Both
were extremely fatigued and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>The king, on opening his eyes, perceived
that Ziethen had slipped off his seat and that a
grenadier was placing a fagot under his head
for a pillow. In a loud voice Frederick said:</p>

<p>“Bravo! the old gentleman is very tired!”
Soon after, a grenadier got up, half asleep, in
order to light his pipe by the fire, and carelessly
touched the General’s foot. The king,
who was glad to see Ziethen take a little
much needed rest, held up his hand and said
whisperingly:</p>

<p>“Take care, grenadier, not to waken the
General; he is very sleepy.”</p>

<h3>A Double Reward</h3>

<p>General Seydlitz once reported to Frederick
II one of the skirmishes such as happened
almost daily during the seven years’ war, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
in doing so, praised a Lieutenant, whose conduct
and splendid bravery well merited an
order. The king had the young officer summoned
and said to him pleasantly:</p>

<p>“I hear you have been very brave. I will
reward you for it. Here are a hundred Friedrichsd’or,
and here is the order of merit. You
may choose.”</p>

<p>Without a moment’s hesitation, the officer
took the money.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to have much regard for
honor, anyway,” said the king, displeased.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, your Majesty,” replied the
officer frankly, “I have debts, and honor demands
that I should pay them as soon as possible.
I hope to earn and return for the order
in a few days.”</p>

<p>“That is brave, my son,” said the king,
patting the Lieutenant’s shoulder. “You may
take the order now; you deserve it!”</p>

<h3>A Scarcity of Chairs</h3>

<p>One morning while out riding near Potsdam,
Frederick met a post-chaise in which sat one of
his generals, who had numerous debts.</p>

<p>“Why my dear W.,” said the king to him,
“you are off early; where are you going?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>“To Potsdam, your Majesty, to have an
understanding with my creditors.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” smiled Frederick, “you would have
done that better at Berlin; there are certainly
not chairs enough at Potsdam.”</p>

<h3>He Turned the Tables</h3>

<p>Frederick the Great was passionately fond of
playing the flute. One of his teachers for
years, was J. Quantz, the famous flutist, who
was also well known for his quick, witty answers.
One evening after the usual concert,
the king was conversing with his intimates,
when Quantz made the remark that nothing
could upset him, no matter how great the surprise.
Frederick turned to him and said,
laughing:</p>

<p>“Quantz, Quantz, you shall prove that to
me,” to which Quantz replied with dignity:</p>

<p>“Your Majesty, I am ready for any test.”</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, Quantz was to play a
solo on his flute, during the evening concert.
On going to his desk, he found on his music
a large sheet of paper on which was written:
“Quantz is an ass! Frederick II.”</p>

<p>Not in the least disturbed, Quantz quietly
folded the paper and was going to put it into his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
pocket, when the King who had been watching
him, cried:</p>

<p>“Here, Quantz, what are you hiding there?
Let me see what it is!”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” replied the former, “some
one has been trying to have a poor joke at my
expense. It is not worth taking notice of.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Frederick, apparently surprised,
“you must read it, Quantz; you ought to let
me hear what has been written to you!”</p>

<p>Quantz bowed, and unfolding the paper,
said:</p>

<p>“If your Majesty wishes it, I cannot refuse.”
Then, sharply accenting each word, he read
aloud: “Johann Quantz is an ass; <i>Frederick
the second</i>!”</p>

<p>Everybody grew pale; some grasped their
swords, but the King went smiling up to Quantz,
patted him on the shoulder and said:</p>

<p>“Well done, Quantz, but another time you
must not be quite so rude; do you hear?”</p>

<h3>A Chronic Cough</h3>

<p>At all the evening concerts, the King played the
flute. Once he played a new composition of his
own, which contained a faulty passage. Quantz,
on hearing it, coughed significantly. Frederick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
understood the meaning of it, but said nothing.
The next day he asked one of the other musicians
his opinion of the passage. The latter pointed
out the mistake. The King corrected it at
once, saying:</p>

<p>“We must not let Quantz get a chronic
cough.”</p>

<h3>No Relation</h3>

<p>After one of the victorious battles of the seven
years’ war, Frederick the Great gave orders that
a young cornet, whose bravery he had had occasion
to witness himself, be brought to him.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” the monarch asked
the young man.</p>

<p>“Von Stira Stora Stazarneda, your Majesty,”
was the answer.</p>

<p>“What, sir,” cried the King, indignant at a
name so hard to remember, “why, the devil
isn’t called that!”</p>

<p>“He is no relative of mine, either, your
Majesty,” was the impudent cornet’s prompt
answer.</p>

<p>The King smiled, and said:</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear it, <i>Lieutenant</i> von
Stira Stora Stazarneda,” and with a wave of
his hand, dismissed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<h3>Plenty of Company</h3>

<p>The Prussian Ambassador at the Court of
England, wrote to Frederick the Great that his
salary being insufficient, he would be compelled
to sell his carriage and go to Court on foot.
The King answered laconically: “You can
just walk; it won’t hurt you. If anybody
makes a remark about it, you can tell them you
are my ambassador, and 300,000 men are walking
behind you.”</p>

<h3>No Suggestions Wanted</h3>

<p>From the beginning of the War of Independence
(1813-14, against Napoleon I) Field-Marshal
Prince Blücher urged the allied powers to
go forward (hence his name, Marshal Vorwärts)
and thus created more confusion among them
than among the enemy. But the old soldier
did not pay the slightest attention to that.
Once when he received a dispatch to turn back
with his army he growled:</p>

<p>“Those diplomatic fool tricks and this scribbling
of notes will have to be stopped. I shall
direct this campaign without notes.”</p>

<h3>Cobblers Lacking</h3>

<p>Once, while trying to ascertain the enemy’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
whereabouts, a bullet struck Prince Blücher’s
foot, but fortunately tore only his boot.</p>

<p>“That’s bad enough,” joked Blücher, “we
have a good many more doctors than cobblers
with us.”</p>

<h3>Deserved a Title</h3>

<p>When presented with a Doctor’s degree at
Oxford, Blücher said:</p>

<p>“Well, now, you ought to make Gneisenau
at least a druggist, for he made my pills.”</p>

<h3>The Two Moves</h3>

<p>After a hard day, Blücher was taking a few
hours’ rest. An Adjutant wakened him to report:
“The enemy has made a move!”</p>

<p>“Well,” cried the Prince, “then report to
the enemy that I made one too!” and with this
he turned over on his other side.</p>

<h3>Another Victory</h3>

<p>Blücher was a great lover of music. His
favorite pieces electrified him as often as he
heard them, but of them all Mozart’s “Magic
Flute” took first place. While the allies were at
Aachen, Angelica Catalani, the famous singer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
aroused everybody’s enthusiasm. The Emperor
Alexander of Russia stood at the head of her
admirers, but her acknowledged favorite was the
aged Marshal Vorwärts.</p>

<p>One evening Catalani sang at a large reception
and one of her songs was Papageno’s
“Ring, Little Bell, Ring.” Blücher was delighted,
and asked her to sing another of Papageno’s
songs, but the singer, greatly embarrassed,
had to confess that she knew no other.</p>

<p>“I can teach you,” said Blücher; “I know
every aria in the ‘Magic Flute.’”</p>

<p>“What,” cried Emperor Alexander, “Blücher
can sing too? You must give us a song then!”</p>

<p>The old soldier stood up and began in his
rough voice, dreadfully out of tune, but still
recognizable: “The Bird Catcher I Am.”</p>

<p>Emperor Francis listened with visible emotion,
the dignified King of Prussia smiled quietly to
himself, while Emperor Alexander laughed as
hard as he could and started a vigorous applause.
Blücher, encouraged, sang again, and
wound up with “Bacchus is a Brave Man.”
The last number created such a storm of applause
that Catalani said jokingly:</p>

<p>“I can’t compete with old Blücher; he has
beaten me, too; he received more applause than
I did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<h3>Portraits of His Ancestors</h3>

<p>When Field-Marshal Wrangel was Commander-General
of Stettin, he sent for the
painter, Most, and gave him an order to paint
several portraits of his ancestors for his dining-room.
The painter asked if the General had
some pictures to copy from.</p>

<p>“That isn’t necessary,” said Wrangel; “just
make them look somewhat like me, and dress
them correctly. Nobody knew them personally
anyhow.”</p>

<h3>Poor Shots</h3>

<p>Wrangel generally rode a white horse, a fact
which the enemy soon noticed. When the
officers of his suite drew his attention to it and
asked him to ride another horse, to be less exposed
to danger, he answered with his customary
calmness:</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I ride a white horse, gentlemen?
They shoot at me, but they hit you.”</p>

<h3>Could Not Whistle For Laughing</h3>

<p>Wrangel was once walking with the Crown
Prince, later Emperor Frederick, “unter den
Linden” in Berlin, when they met a shoemaker’s
apprentice merrily whistling. As they came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
near, he stopped, grinned all over his face, and
pulled off his cap.</p>

<p>“Now your Royal Highness can see what
fine fellows these boys are,” said Wrangel;
“they are all delighted to see a member of the
Royal Family.”</p>

<p>“Wrangel,” cried the Crown Prince, laughing,
“you just ask that boy, why he stopped
whistling.”</p>

<p>“Say, sonny,” called Wrangel, “why did
you stop whistling?”</p>

<p>“When I see you, I have to laugh, so I can’t
whistle,” was the reply. The answer pleased
the Crown Prince immensely.</p>

<h3>Under the Weather Vane</h3>

<p>When Wrangel returned from the war with
Holstein, he ordered a weather-vane for the
roof of his palace, just like one he had seen
during the campaign, an Uhlan with his lance
at rest.</p>

<p>“But he must turn whichever way the wind
blows, like any other well-regulated weather-vane,”
said Wrangel, “or I shan’t pay for it.”</p>

<p>The Uhlan was made, put on the roof and
the General was informed of it. Well pleased,
Wrangel went to the window.</p>

<p>“Why I can’t see him, you swindler!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>“But your Excellency——”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, there are dozens of Excellencies.
I am General-Field-Marshal.”</p>

<p>“But Herr General-Field-Marshal; you cannot
see the weather-vane on the roof, while you
are under it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that is true; but what good is
the weather-vane to me, if I can’t see it?”</p>

<p>After thinking it over for some time, Wrangel
stated the case to the French Ambassador across
the street, who was perfectly willing to have the
Uhlan put on the roof of his house. Now
Wrangel could see the Uhlan from his room,
and always knew which way the wind blew.
Could he possibly have known, what he did,
when he put the Uhlan on the Frenchman’s
roof?</p>

<h3>An Unfortunate Remark</h3>

<p>An officer came to report to Papa Wrangel,
as he was often called. The General noticed
that the officer’s spurs were not those prescribed
by regulations. He took him to task about it,
and gave him twenty-four hours house-arrest.
The officer seeing that Wrangel wore the same
spurs, made a remark about it.</p>

<p>“Very well, my son,” said the General,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
“then you stay another twenty-four hours for
me.”</p>

<h3>A Profitable Call</h3>

<p>King Frederick William III was in the habit
of coming to the Queen’s sitting-room every
morning, to breakfast with her, preferably on
some fresh fruit. One morning, he saw on her
work-table a pretty new lace cap. Smiling, he
asked the price of it.</p>

<p>“It is not necessary,” replied the Queen
merrily, “that the men should know what
women’s finery costs; they don’t understand,
and think everything is too dear.”</p>

<p>“But you can tell me what the cap cost. I
should like to know!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I chose a cheap one; it was only
four thalers.”</p>

<p>“Only? Why that’s a lot of money for a
thing like that!”</p>

<p>The king, standing by the window, kept on
teasing her, until an invalid soldier of his guard
passed by. The King called him into the room.
He had hardly entered when the King said to
him:</p>

<p>“The lady on the sofa there has a lot of
money. What do you think, old comrade, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
gave for that cap on the table? Now don’t let
the pretty pink ribbon dazzle you!”</p>

<p>The old fellow, inexperienced in such things,
said:</p>

<p>“Well, it may have cost a few groschen.”</p>

<p>“There, do you hear that?” laughed the
King. “Oh, yes; groschen. She paid four
thalers for it! Now you go over there and let
the beautiful lady give you as much.”</p>

<p>Looking at the King, she quickly opened her
purse and put four thalers into the old soldier’s
hand. “But,” she added with a mischievous
smile, “the gentleman at the window has much
more money than I. All I have I owe to him,
and he loves to give. Just go over and let him
give you double the amount.” The lucky veteran
departed, delighted with his morning call.</p>

<h3>Dislike of Formality</h3>

<p>Frederick William III was not fond of the
extremely formal court etiquette prevailing at
the time. Even as Crown Prince, he gave
numerous proofs of his dislike of the stiff formalities
which prevented an intimate family life.
Once the mistress of ceremonies, Frau von Voss,
reproved him for speaking of the Queen as
“my wife” instead of saying “her Royal Highness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
the Crown Princess.” The King promising
to reform said:</p>

<p>“Now, my dear Voss, announce me to her
Royal Highness the Crown Princess, and ask if
I may have the honor to speak to her Royal
Highness.”</p>

<p>The mistress of ceremonies went to fulfil his
command, walking with the slow, dignified,
solemn step which etiquette prescribed. When
she entered the Queen’s apartment, the King,
who was already there, sitting arm in arm with
his “Louise,” called to the horrified lady:</p>

<p>“Why my dear Voss, her Royal Highness,
the Crown Princess, is not to be seen for an
hour, and I mean to spend that time with ‘my
wife.’”</p>

<h3>Too Much Work</h3>

<p>Queen Louise, the mother of Emperor
William I, was once told that her sons ate
their fruit with too much haste. The Queen at
once gave the order that every piece of fruit for
the Princes’ breakfast-table should be wrapped
in thirty pieces of paper. The unwrapping
proved a sure remedy against their eating too
fast. Emperor William I often recalled this
rule saying jokingly:</p>

<p>“From my youth up, nothing was ever made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
easy for me. Even to get a rosy-cheeked apple
was considerable work.”</p>

<h3>Too Hungry for Speeches</h3>

<p>Frederick William IV, later Emperor William
I, never liked to listen to long speeches when
he was received into a city. One day, after
having traveled for many hours in a post-chaise,
he reached the gates of a small town about
noon, tired and hungry. Here the King was
received by the officials, and the burgomaster
began a long-winded speech with:</p>

<p>“Most high and most gracious King! When
Hannibal stood before the gates of Carthage——”</p>

<p>“He was probably as hungry as I am.
Come, my dear burgomaster, get into my carriage
and be my guest.”</p>

<h3>Too Much for Him</h3>

<p>On a certain occasion when Frederick William
IV had reached a small town, the burgomaster
began his speech:</p>

<p>“Five thousand citizens——” (here he
stopped). “Five thousand citizens——” (he
began again). “Five thousand citizens——”
(No, he couldn’t do it.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>“Please greet your five thousand citizens for
me,” the King interrupted him now, “but each
one separately!” and drove on.</p>

<h3>Through Thick and Thin</h3>

<p>King Frederick William IV was always
a most gay and amiable host. Once at a
ball he stood in the ball-room talking to a very
tall and very slender gentleman. Suddenly, an
officer of the hussars, in the whirl of the dance,
chased with his partner right between the two.
The officer frightened to death, stops at once
and excuses himself.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the King, laughing;
“don’t excuse yourself; a hussar must necessarily
go through <i>thick</i> and <i>thin</i>.”</p>

<h3>He Helped the Donkey</h3>

<p>One day, while Frederick William IV was
taking a walk at an early morning hour, he
noticed from a distance, a woman, who was
beating the donkey drawing her milkcart. He
went near and asked the cause of her violence.
With tears in her eyes the woman said:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I am in a great hurry, and this
stupid donkey won’t go. If I don’t get to
Potsdam at the usual time, I’ll lose all my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
customers. I know his tricks. If I only had
somebody who would take him by the ears,
while I beat him from behind—he would go all
right.”</p>

<p>The King soberly grabbed the donkey by his
ears, the woman did her part, and the donkey
began to trot, while his owner thanked her unknown
helper heartily.</p>

<p>At home the King told his wife of the service
he had rendered. The Queen did not approve
of the proceeding, and said:</p>

<p>“As Crown Prince, my dear Fritz, you
might have done that, but as King——”</p>

<p>“My dear child,” interrupted the smiling
monarch, “my sainted father helped many a
donkey along.”</p>

<h3>Changed His Order</h3>

<p>The livery-stable-keeper, Faber, of Magdeburg,
who had been very patriotic and generous
during the war with France, asked permission
to drive Emperor William on his first visit
to Magdeburg after the war, in a carriage he
had built for the purpose. Permission was
granted, and he was rewarded with an order of
the fourth class. When the Emperor went to
Magdeburg the next time, Faber drove him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
again, but this time standing. “Why do you
drive standing, Faber?” asked the Emperor.</p>

<p>“The fourth-class always does, your Majesty;
they ride standing” (in a railway train),
replied Faber, pointing at his order. The
Emperor laughed heartily, and Faber received
an order of the third class.</p>

<h3>His Early Reign</h3>

<p>In 1878, while Emperor William was recovering
from the wound made by Nobiling in his
murderous attack, Crown Prince Frederick
transacted all business of state. After the first
few days of pain and excitement were over, and
as the Emperor grew stronger, his gay humor
returned.</p>

<p>One morning as the Crown Prince came
in to see him, the Emperor, extending his
sound hand asked:</p>

<p>“Well, dear Fritz, have you reigned already
this morning?”</p>

<h3>Too Much Game</h3>

<p>Once after a hunt, the Emperor was told that
he had killed twenty-eight pieces of game. He
looked surprised and said gaily:</p>

<p>“This reminds me of the words: ‘There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
are things happening between heaven and earth
of which man has no conception,’ for it certainly
is wonderful that I killed twenty-eight
pieces of game, when I shot off only twenty-five
cartridges!”</p>

<h3>The Greater Lion</h3>

<p>One summer morning, in 1874, while Emperor
William I was taking the water cure at
Ems, the following humorous incident happened.
He and Emperor Alexander II had as usual taken
their morning walk together, and then seated
themselves on a bench of the promenade near
the Trinkhalle. The chance of getting a good
look at the two rulers was not to be lost by the
summer guests, and soon a crowd was walking
up and down in front of their bench. The
Czar who did not like to be stared at, made an
impatient remark about it, when Emperor William,
pointing to Bismarck who was just passing
and bowing respectfully, said:</p>

<p>“Now we shall have peace!”</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked the Czar, surprised.</p>

<p>“Why?” returned the Emperor, “because
there goes Bismarck; <i>he is more famous than we
are</i>! The people will run after him now and
give us a rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<h3>At His Expense</h3>

<p>After recuperating for some weeks at Berchtesgaden,
in the Austrian Alps, during the summer of 1886,
Prince William, the present Emperor
of Germany, accompanied by the Princess,
went to Salzburg to meet their royal grandfather.
The aged monarch asked the Princess how she
had enjoyed herself.</p>

<p>“Oh very much indeed,” she said, “only at
times I was dreadfully homesick. I do so long
to see my children.”</p>

<p>The Emperor asked, smilingly:</p>

<p>“But why didn’t you bring your little ones
with you; the mountain air would have been
splendid for them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but grandpapa, it would have cost too
much!”</p>

<p>The Emperor nodded assent: “You are
right; three little Princes do cost a good
deal.”</p>

<p>When the royal family met for a late supper,
the Emperor handed a telegram to his granddaughter.
She looked at it, scarcely able to
comprehend the contents, until the old gentleman
said with a kindly smile:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“No need to keep you in suspense</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The children are coming—at my expense.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<h3>The Emperor’s Thoughtfulness</h3>

<p>While the Emperor and Empress were at Ems,
Count von Gneisenau, a son of the famous general
of that name, was often asked to dine at the
royal table. It was his habit always to decline
the after-dinner coffee. One day he had again
been a guest at dinner. A lackey offered him a
cup of coffee. The Count declined, without interrupting
his conversation with the Empress.
A second time a cup was offered to him, and before
he could decline again, the Empress said:
“Do take that cup!”</p>

<p>The Count obeyed, but held the cup in his
hand. The Emperor coming up to them remarked:
“Why, Gneisenau, you are not drinking
your coffee!”</p>

<p>The Count murmured a few words of excuse.
“Well, you might at least look at the cup!”</p>

<p>Gneisenau did so. Tears of emotion dimmed
his eyes. On the cup was the portrait of his
father. With a benevolent smile, the Emperor
said:</p>

<p>“I saw that cup this morning in one of the
stalls of the promenade and bought it for you!
You must always drink out of it.”</p>

<h3>Socks with Knots</h3>

<p>The little Princess Feodora, of Sachsen-Meiningen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
a great-granddaughter of Emperor William
I, was learning to knit, and the first thing
she wanted to do was to knit a pair of warm
socks for her beloved great-grandpapa at Berlin.
In a few weeks the task was accomplished and
the gift sent off. It pleased the Emperor so
much that he insisted on putting the socks on
at once.</p>

<p>During the evening it was noticed that his
face looked drawn, as if he was in pain; but on
being asked if he was ill, he said smilingly:</p>

<p>“Do not worry, I am all right; but Feodora
has made such a lot of immense hard knots in
her socks, that I feel as if I were screwed into
one of the old instruments of the inquisition!”</p>

<h3>A Cause for Thankfulness</h3>

<p>A general once asked the Emperor for a detachment
of cavalry, for service at the capital of
his province. Laughing, the Emperor said:</p>

<p>“My dear general, you will have to ask that
man,” pointing towards Moltke; “he alone disposes
of our army. I must be thankful if he
leaves me my guards!”</p>

<h3>Equal to the Occasion</h3>

<p>The Emperor was an enthusiastic sportsman.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
One day, while on a hunt with a number of royal
guests, he grew tired, and decided to go home
quietly. Two of his guests, noticing this, accompanied
him. They had walked along the road
some distance when a farmer with his wagon
overtook them. One of the gentlemen asked
him to take them along for a consideration.
The farmer consented and the three climbed into
the farm-wagon.</p>

<p>Curiosity soon got the better of the countryman,
and turning to one of the gentlemen, he
asked:</p>

<p>“And who might you be?”</p>

<p>“I am the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg.”</p>

<p>“May the——!” cried the farmer, laughing; and
turning to the second gentleman, he
asked “and who are you?”</p>

<p>“I,” replied he, “am the King of Saxony!”</p>

<p>“Why, this is getting better,” cried the
amused farmer. Finally he turned to the third
gunner with:</p>

<p>“Well, and who are you?”</p>

<p>“I am William, Emperor of Germany!”</p>

<p>“Well, this beats all!” said the countryman,
partly amused, partly indignant, “but I
should certainly not have thought that such old
dignified gentlemen would find pleasure in fooling
the likes of me! So that you may know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
who is driving you, I’ll introduce myself: I, I
am the Shah of Persia!”</p>

<p>The shouts of laughter at this sally made the
gentlemen forget their fatigue.</p>

<h3>The Day’s Expenses</h3>

<p>While Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria was
on his last visit to Emperor William at the
shooting-lodge, Letzlingen, the two, with four
other royal gunners, were playing a game of
billiards at fifty pfennig, about eleven cents,
each.</p>

<p>The Emperor won, and soon after retired, but
returned again to give some directions about the
next day’s hunt. The gentlemen were still
playing.</p>

<p>“What is this game you are playing?” asked
the Emperor.</p>

<p>“Oh, a child’s game, your Majesty, called
‘<i>Meine Tante, deine Tante</i>,’ my aunt, your
aunt, or ‘<i>Naschi-Waschi</i>.’”</p>

<p>“I can play that,” said the Emperor, and
staked the thaler he had just won, and won another.
Smiling, the Emperor put the money in
his vest pocket when one of the gentlemen remarked:
“Your Majesty might try it again,”
but he replied, “No, thank you, this just covers
to-day’s expenses,” and retired again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<h3>Contents of the Drawer</h3>

<p>While visiting the Victoria-Bazaar, the Emperor
asked one of the ladies, just to please her,
to explain the construction of the sewing-machine
to him and the Empress, who was with
him. After other questions he asked for what
the little drawer was used. “To keep the small
utensils belonging to the machine in,” answered
the young lady, somewhat embarrassed. The
Emperor expected that she would pull the little
drawer out, but when she did not do so, he concluded
correctly, that the contents were not as
they should be. With a gay “With your permission?”
he pulled the drawer out and saw
an appetizing sandwich reposing there. Smilingly
the Emperor asked the young lady:</p>

<p>“Does this utensil belong to the machine
too?”</p>

<p>Quickly the lady replied: “Yes, your Majesty,
to the machine of the human body.”</p>

<p>Greatly pleased with this witty remark, the
Emperor turned to the Empress, saying: “This
proves that sewing-machines do not dull the
working of the brain.”</p>

<h3>That Was Different</h3>

<p>After Emperor William had recovered from
a severe illness in the spring of 1885, his physicians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
would not give their consent to his attending
the coming manœuvres on horseback. They
feared the great exertion would be too much
for the aged monarch, who was then eighty-eight
years old, and proposed that he should review
them in a carriage.</p>

<p>“Impossible,” said the Emperor; “there is
nothing more unsoldierly!”</p>

<p>“But your Majesty,” a General ventured to
say, “even Frederick the Great attended manœuvres
in a carriage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied the aged monarch, “but
he only did so during the last years of his
life.”</p>

<h3>Coffee Instead of Water</h3>

<p>While traveling in cold weather one time, the
Empress Augusta stopped at Dessau to have
the hot bottle for her feet replenished. The
Adjutant and a lackey with the bottle, hurried
into the restaurant to ask for hot water. The
attendant had just used the last of it to make
coffee, and after running around in great confusion
he declared:</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, but there is not a drop of
hot water.”</p>

<p>“What,” called a gentleman standing at the
buffet, “you have no hot water?” and instantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
seizing the full coffee-pot he poured the
boiling contents into the warming bottle, and
the guests had to do without coffee for breakfast.</p>

<p>The Adjutant hurried out with his prey, but
soon returned to ask, in her Majesty’s behalf,
the name of the inventor of the brilliant idea.</p>

<p>“My name is Cohn,” said he. He was afterwards
for a long time Emperor William’s private
banker.</p>

<h3>Had No Use For It</h3>

<p>A sly dry goods merchant once sent to Emperor
William a magnificent silk lounging gown,
thinking that that would bring him the custom
of the Court. The Emperor however sent the
gown back with the laconical words: “The
Hohenzollerns do not wear lounging gowns.”</p>

<h3>Made For the Boys</h3>

<p>One day the Crown Prince Frederick William,
later Emperor Frederick, was walking alone
in the streets of Berlin. Suddenly an old Jew
accosted him with the question: “Any old
clothes?” The Crown Prince did not see him
at first. “Any old clothes, any old clothes?”
the Jew, who did not know whom he was pestering,
kept calling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>At last the Crown Prince stood still, looked
at the Jew astonished, but asked pleasantly:
“What is it you wish?” The dealer in old
clothes scraped a bow and said: “Have you
any old clothes to sell?” At this the Crown
Prince laughed outright and answered: “My
good friend, I have a large family, and there
are no old clothes; when I am done with anything,
it is made over for the boys.”</p>

<h3>A Change of Methods</h3>

<p>While the Crown Prince Frederick William
was dedicating a chapel of the University at
Halle, he noticed among the students drawn up
in line, one whose face was a mass of scars.
Turning to Dr. Volkman, the well-known
surgeon, he said, jovially: “That head gave
you a lot of mending to do!”</p>

<p>“Ah, your Royal Highness,” answered the
man of science, “that sort of thing we sew only
by machine now!”</p>

<h3>Presented With a Leg</h3>

<p>In honor of the presence of a number of
crowned heads, who were taking the waters, a
gala performance was to be given at the theatre
of Hamburg. The first to appear in the royal
box was the Grandduke of Hesse, with two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
Princesses. He took a chair and sat down between
them, when the chair broke to pieces and
his Royal Highness found himself sitting upon
the floor. The accident created great merriment
both in the royal box and among the
audience.</p>

<p>Soon after, the Crown Prince Frederick William
appeared in the box, and when told of the
mishap, laughed heartily and took pains to
throw himself heavily into his chair, but it held
together. Finally the Prince of Wales, now
King Edward, appeared. The Crown Prince at
once presented to him the leg of the chair with
the most comical solemnity.</p>

<h3>Followed Instructions</h3>

<p>When Emperor William and the Crown
Prince visited Erfurt after the war with France,
the youths of the city enthusiastically greeted
the latter, whom they adored. The Crown
Prince leaning from his carriage called out:
“Boys, in the carriage behind is Moltke;
scream for all you are worth!”</p>

<p>And the boys certainly did it.</p>

<h3>Without Success</h3>

<p>One evening Alfred Grünfeld, the piano
virtuoso, was playing before the Crown Prince<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
and Crown Princess. After the performance
the Crown Prince patted Grünfeld’s shoulder
saying, “Do you know, my friend, that we are,
in a sense, colleagues?” Grünfeld bowed, but
had to acknowledge that he really did not know
how he came to the honor of being a colleague
of his Royal Highness.</p>

<p>“Well, I will tell you,” said the Crown
Prince. “I was, like yourself, a pupil of
Kullak’s, but—now you must not give this
away—the good Kullak wanted to make something
of me, as he did of you, and he didn’t
succeed.”</p>

<h3>No Speeches, Please</h3>

<p>While inspecting St. George’s Church, in
Nördlingen, the Crown Prince praised the
splendor and size of it. He was told that the
Catholic Church in Dinkelsbühl was even larger
and more beautiful, and he decided to visit that
also. The burgomaster at Dinkelsbühl was
notified by a telegram, so the city fathers
awaited the Crown Prince. When he arrived,
the burgomaster advanced to make a speech,
but the Crown Prince declined to listen, saying:
“Let me tell you something; we two will make
a compact. You promise not to say anything,
and I’ll do the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<h3>Obedience to Rules</h3>

<p>The Crown Prince, while in Dresden, visited
the Johaneum, the famous collection of arms.
Talking and smoking he walked about, when
suddenly he noticed a sign: “Smoking strictly
forbidden.” At once he took his costly Havana
from his lips, put it into a boy’s mouth
saying: “There, you finish it, I must obey the
rules.”</p>

<h3>Sausage as a Remedy</h3>

<p>While studying at the University of Göttingen,
Bismarck was taken ill one day. The
doctor was sent for and ordered quinine. Soon
after he had left, a big box of “eatables”
arrived from home. Bismarck went at it, consumed
about two pounds of sausage, washed
down with several glasses of beer, and then
went to sleep. The fever left him.</p>

<p>Next day when the doctor came he said:
“Thank heaven, dear doctor, the fever is
gone.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the doctor, “quinine is a
most excellent remedy.”</p>

<p>“Well it wasn’t exactly this time, you best of
doctors, but two pounds of sausage had the
same effect, and nature may do the rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<h3>To Suit All Parties</h3>

<p>When the new two-mark piece was issued, a
number proposed to call it Bis-mark, bis being
the Latin for twice. The National Liberals
would then have Bismarck in their pockets, the
Socialists would see him beaten, the Ultramontanes
could get him changed whenever they
liked, and to the Government, the formation of
a Bismarck party, would insure the most wide-spread
influence.</p>

<h3>He Rose</h3>

<p>Prince Bismarck and Count Kleist-Retzow,
friends and related to each other, accepted an
invitation to a hunt of several days. The first
day the two followed the noble sport with great
zest. When they returned in the evening,
Kleist-Retzow was so very much fatigued that
he told Bismarck that he would not rise at
seven the following morning to continue the
hunt. While talking gaily over their wine,
Bismarck said that he would take care that
he got out of his bed whether he liked it or not.
After they had retired, the Count locked and
barricaded his door against Bismarck’s attack
the next morning, and then went to bed. But
once more Bismarck’s voice came from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
next room admonishing his friend to be sure
and rise in good time.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet; I want to go to sleep,” replied
Kleist-Retzow.</p>

<p>“Yes, and you’ll get up when I want you to,
I’ll give you my word for that,” returned Bismarck,
and then went to sleep himself. At
half-past six in the morning, the Chancellor
knocked at Kleist-Retzow’s door and as it was
not opened, he called to him to get up. The
Count had not the slightest intention of doing
so, and Bismarck assured him again that he
would be out of his bed by seven. Kleist-Retzow
lay still and paid no attention to him.
Bismarck took his shotgun, went into the yard,
stood before the window of his friend’s bedroom
and shot through it into the ceiling, so
that the plaster fell down upon the Count’s
head. Kleist-Retzow, very much frightened,
jumped up at once and went to the window to
see what had happened. Seeing nobody, he
quickly put on his clothes and hurried down-stairs.
Bismarck came to meet him, greeted him, and
without changing a muscle, said: “I hope you
have rested well; it is just seven o’clock!”</p>

<h3>A Novel Signal</h3>

<p>In 1871, while Bismarck, as Ambassador of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
the Confederation, lived at Frankfort, he occupied
rooms in a private house. There was no
bell in his study with which to call his valet
from his room on the floor above, so he requested
his landlord to have one put in. That
gentleman, who was not a friend of “that Prussian,”
declined to do so, saying, that his
tenants always had done things of that sort at
their own expense, and he didn’t see why he
should make an exception now.</p>

<p>Some time later in the day a pistol-shot rang
through the house. Very much frightened, the
landlord ran through all the rooms until he
came to Bismarck’s study, where the still smoking
pistol lay on the table, and the smoking
Bismarck sat quietly at work.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, what has happened?”
cried the landlord.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” said Bismarck, “that you
need worry about. I just signaled to my valet
that I want him. It is a perfectly harmless
signal. I hope you will soon get used to it.”</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add that Bismarck
got his bell in short order.</p>

<h3>Despatch Sending Without Suspicion</h3>

<p>One day, while the peace negotiations were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
in progress, the representative from Hanover
asked Bismarck how he managed to get his
despatches through the mails unopened. Bismarck,
for answer, asked him to take a walk
with him. He took him to the poor district of
Frankfort, to a narrow street where only small
stores were to be found. Arrived before a
little grocery, Bismarck, to his companion’s
surprise, put on gloves and then entered the
store. His first question to the clerk was:
“Do you keep soap?”</p>

<p>“Yes sir.”</p>

<p>“What kinds?”</p>

<p>The clerk put several kinds before Bismarck,
from which the latter selected a particularly
strong-smelling piece, and put it in his pocket.
Then he asked for envelopes and was shown
some of the very cheapest kind. Now Bismarck
took a despatch from his inside coat-pocket,
put it into one of the envelopes, fastened
it, and asked for pen and ink and began to
write the address. But of course with gloves
he could not do it, so he asked the clerk to do
it for him. Then he put the envelope with the
despatch into the same pocket with the soap.
When they were on the street again Bismarck
said to his companion: “Now, I defy them to
smell my despatch under a perfume composed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
of soap, herring, and cheese, and an address
written in such a hand.”</p>

<h3>The Overburdened Horse</h3>

<p>Prince Bismarck was suffering from great
nervousness at one time, and was obliged to
stop smoking and drinking wine altogether for
some weeks. When he complained to Emperor
William about it, his Majesty said:</p>

<p>“There you see the difference between us. I
am ever so much older than you, but I enjoy
my cigar, can take a glass of wine, and am
very well with it all.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, your Majesty, that is an old
story,” returned the Chancellor; “the rider always
has it easier than the horse.”</p>

<h3>Without Intent</h3>

<p>Lord Russell, the English ambassador at the
German court, called one day on Prince Bismarck
at the palace of the latter, in Berlin.
During conversation, Lord Russell remarked, that
a man in the Chancellor’s position must be bothered
with a great many troublesome callers.</p>

<p>“God knows how true that is,” sighed the
Prince.</p>

<p>“But you certainly have some remedy or
other to get rid of such people quickly?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>“Oh certainly,” laughed Bismarck, “one of
my best is, that my wife comes in to call me
away on some pretext or other. Of course the
caller can’t remain after that.”</p>

<p>These words were hardly uttered, when the
Princess entered, and said in the most harmless
way: “Otto, it is time to take your medicine;
do not forget it.”</p>

<p>Lord Russell broke into a ringing laugh and
took his leave at once.</p>

<h3>A Monotonous Diet</h3>

<p>The following humorous story was first published
in the Leipsic <i>Tageblatt</i>. One day, during
the siege of Paris, Count Lehndorff, the
Aide-de-Camp, visited Captain von Strantz, at
Ville d’Avray, an outpost near Paris. In reply
to the Count’s question, how he was getting on,
the Captain said: “Oh quite well; I have just
been dining for the sixty-seventh time off roast
mutton.” The Count laughed and rode on.
Next day an orderly called on the Captain with
the following message: “It having come to the
ears of Count Bismarck, Chancellor of the Confederation,
that Captain von Strantz would
doubtless be dining off his sixty-eighth joint of
mutton to-day, his Excellency sends him herewith
four ducks as a change of diet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<h3>They Danced to His Music</h3>

<p>In May, 1891, a curious circumstance which,
having occurred just before Bismarck’s fall,
might have indicated to him how slippery was
the ground on which he trod. He went one
day to see the Emperor, who was busy, and who
sent word that he would see the Chancellor presently.
Ere long the royal children came in,
and insisted upon his dancing with them.
“No,” said Bismarck, “I am too old to dance
with you.” “Then you must play,” they said.
He accordingly sat down to the piano. Pretty
soon the Emperor came in, and, finding him
thus engaged said: “So, here is the fourth generation
of the Hohenzollerns, which has to dance
to your playing.”</p>

<h3>The Better Cigar</h3>

<p>Bismarck once gave to some friends the following
droll account of Count Moltke.</p>

<p>“When a declaration of war is floating in the
air,” the Chancellor said, “even Moltke gets
talkative, and when we were in for it in 1870, he
grew ten years younger in a day. Before, taciturn
and cross, he now chatted pleasantly, got
an appetite for champagne and heavy cigars, and
lost the last remnant of gout that he had acquired
while resting on laurels that had grown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
old. But at any rate, the famous old General is
a comforting example for all enthusiastic smokers.
He shows how healthy smoking is, and
that one can grow old doing it. He showed his
fondness for a good cigar even in the battle of
Königgrätz.</p>

<p>“On that memorable day in July, 1866, when
victory and defeat hung for hours in the balance,
I was filled with disquietude and apprehension.
I rode up to Moltke, who sat on his horse like a
statue, following every movement of the battle.
To talk to him was impossible; but I had in my
case two cigars left, a good one and a bad one.
Without a word I offered the case to Moltke,
and without a word he took it, examined the
two cigars and selected the good one. This
was enough encouragement for me, for I said to
myself, if the General can so calmly select the
better cigar, our chances must be good.”</p>

<h3>His Winter Wheat</h3>

<p>Directly after the declaration of war, in 1870,
an old friend met Count Moltke on the street,
and remarked:</p>

<p>“You must be overburdened with work just
now!”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” was the cold-blooded answer, “the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
work was all done beforehand. All orders are
issued, and I have really nothing to do!”</p>

<p>A few minutes later, he met a merchant, with
whom he had done business at Kreisau, who
asked him anxiously about the outlook. “Well,”
said the old Field-Marshal in his mildest tone,
“I am quite content; my barley crop, it is true,
was only middling, but my crop of winter wheat
promises to be immense and that, as you know,
is the main thing.”</p>

<h3>Looked Like One of Them</h3>

<p>Once, while Moltke was at Ragaz for his
health, he walked alone through the woods to
the village Pfäfers. It was very warm and he
was thirsty, so he went into the village inn and
asked for a drink. The host sat down by him
and began:</p>

<p>“I suppose you are a guest at Ragaz?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“They say Moltke is there too!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How does he look?”</p>

<p>“Well, how should he look? Just like one
of us two.”</p>

<h3>Wig Instead of Handkerchief</h3>

<p>It was at Meaux, the night before the siege of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
Paris began. All the Chiefs and Generals of the
different divisions of the army, were assembled
in the Field-Marshal’s quarters, discussing plans
and studying maps and charts. It was two
o’clock in the morning; a big fire was burning
in the grate; the room was intensely warm.</p>

<p>Moltke, so one of the officers tells us, was in a
long dressing gown, without his wig, was walking
up and down, deeply engrossed in thought.
The heat made the perspiration stream down
our faces. Suddenly one of us looked up to ask
the Field-Marshal a question, but stopped short
and drew the attention of the others to what he
saw.</p>

<p>The General, too, had found it necessary to
wipe the perspiration from his face, but in his
preoccupation he had not noticed, that in passing
his night-table, he had picked up his wig
instead of his handkerchief and was vigorously
wiping his face with it. He kept it up for
some time, looking so exceedingly funny that
we broke into shouts of laughter. When we
explained, he joined in our mirth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<i>Students in the Fatherland</i></h2>

</div>

<h3>Obvious</h3>

<p>Professor:—“The old Greeks built their
theatres in such a way that the spectators sat in
an uncovered space.”</p>

<p>Fresh student:—“But what did the old
Greeks do when they were at the theatre and it
commenced to rain?”</p>

<p>Professor (thoughtfully taking off his spectacles,
polishing them and putting them on
again):—“When it rained at the time the old
Greeks were at the theatre, the old Greeks got
wet.”</p>

<h3>Perhaps He Was Right</h3>

<p>Professor:—“How do you find the size of a
triangle?”</p>

<p>Student (mumbling to himself):—“What a
fool that Professor is; how should I know!”</p>

<p>Professor:—“What is that? Say it again;
perhaps you were right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<h3>A Reminder</h3>

<p>Professor M——, of Königsberg, whose
house faced the cattle market, had a number of
enemies among the hot-headed students. Once
when during a lecture, they created an uproar,
drumming on their desks, he said coldly:
“Gentlemen, for your own sakes I must beg of
you not to remind me where I live.” These
few words soon restored quiet.</p>

<h3>Long Buried</h3>

<p>Professor (at a medical examination, showing
a human bone):—“Can you tell me about how
long this bone might have been buried in the
earth and whether it is of the male or female
sex.”</p>

<p>Student (after thinking for some time):—“The
bone has been in the earth since the
death of its owner, and is of the male sex because
we say: <i>Der</i> Knochen” (masc. article).</p>

<h3>Remember Me</h3>

<p>Professor (making a farewell speech):—“And
now, young gentlemen, as you are entering the
life of the University, I ask you to avoid all
drinking bouts. Beer drinking makes stupid
students. Remember me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<h3>Gave Him Away</h3>

<p>Professor:—“I have to ask your indulgence
for a few minutes. I left my manuscript at
home, but my little son will bring it at once.”</p>

<p>The little son (entering):—“Mother could
not find the manuscript, so she sends you the
book from which you copied it.”</p>

<h3>The Persistent Creditor</h3>

<p>Creditor (who is receiving his money at last):—“There
are still ten marks missing, if you
please!”</p>

<p>Student:—“I shall deduct those from the
amount, for rent, since for the past few months
you lived at my lodgings more than I did.”</p>

<h3>Watchman or Donkey</h3>

<p>Student:—“Herr Nachtwächter (nightwatchman),
I wish to ask you something. May I
call a Nachtwächter a donkey?”</p>

<p>Nachtwächter:—“Just you take yourself off,
before I haul you in.”</p>

<p>Student (goes, but returns after a few steps):—“Now
listen; I have another question. May
I call a donkey a Nachtwächter?”</p>

<p>Nachtwächter:—“You may, for all I care!”</p>

<p>Student:—“Well then, good-night, Herr
Nachtwächter!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<h3>He Had the Watch</h3>

<p>Student:—“What time is it?”</p>

<p>Pawnbroker:—“Did you waken me in the
middle of the night to ask me that?”</p>

<p>Student:—“Why of course, you’ve got my
watch!”</p>

<h3>Knew His Father</h3>

<p>Professor:—“Well, young man, if your father
should borrow a thousand marks, promising to
pay them back in yearly instalments of two
hundred and fifty marks, how much money
would he still owe at the end of three years?”</p>

<p>“A thousand marks.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear sir, you don’t even know
the rudiments of arithmetic.”</p>

<p>“Possibly not; but I know my father.”</p>

<h3>An Acquired Taste</h3>

<p>Student:—“Have you heard the latest news?
Mischler’s brewery has burned down!”</p>

<p>Innkeeper:—“How was that possible, with
so much material on hand to quench fire?”</p>

<p>Student:—“I can easily explain that. When
the flames began to lick the beer, they found
they liked it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<h3>Twice Fetched</h3>

<p>Student (coming home in the evening):—“Has
my overcoat been fetched, Frau Muller?”</p>

<p>Landlady:—“Oh yes; twice.”</p>

<p>Student:—“How is that?”</p>

<p>Landlady:—“Well, you see, first I fetched
it from the tailor, and afterwards the sheriff
fetched it from your room.”</p>

<h3>The Tell-tale Ticket</h3>

<p>The end of the term has arrived. Freshman
Muller has managed, by coaxing all his uncles
and aunts, to scrape enough capital together, to
rescue his dress suit and overcoat from the
pawnshop and is now on his way home. The
following morning, when the first joy of having
him at home again has subsided, his mother
begins to look over his clothes. She finds in
his overcoat the ominous pawnshop number,
and sending for her son, she asks sharply:</p>

<p>“What does this number mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, at the last University ball I left the
coat in the dressing-room, and I suppose they
stuck the number on.”</p>

<p>Only half satisfied with this explanation, his
mother dismisses him, but soon after sends for
him once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>“Now then, I wish to know if you left your
trousers also in the dressing-room at that last
ball?”</p>

<h3>Wonderful Knowledge</h3>

<p>Professor:—“What causes the Northern
Light?”</p>

<p>Student (embarrassed):—“I did know it
perfectly well, but have forgotten it again.”</p>

<p>Professor:—“What an enormous loss for
science! You are the only human being who
knew it once, and you had to forget it!”</p>

<h3>Coffee Not Education</h3>

<p>Porter (to a lot of students who at an early
morning hour, noisily demand admission into a
closed café):—“Gentlemen, you want to have
education?”</p>

<p>Students:—“No, coffee!”</p>

<h3>An Apt Retort</h3>

<p>Professor (very angry):—“You are the
biggest fool here!”</p>

<p>Student (excited):—“Sir! You are forgetting
yourself.”</p>

<h3>The Other Side</h3>

<p>“Is this the famous Kohlenberg?” asked a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
stranger of a student whom he met while ascending
it.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, very famous and very interesting.”</p>

<p>“Would you have the kindness to tell me,”
said the stranger, “whether there are any
legends or other dreadful tales associated with
this mountain?”</p>

<p>“A whole lot, sir, only recently two young
men went up on this side and never came
back.”</p>

<p>“Horrible! What became of them?”</p>

<p>“Why, they went down on the other side.”</p>

<h3>His Occasional Look</h3>

<p>In the waiting-room of a small railway station,
a crowd of noisy young fellows were making
fun of a student, who was walking impatiently
up and down, but stopped from time to time to
look into the mirror. At last the noisiest of the
crowd called out:</p>

<p>“Say, are you in love with yourself, that you
look into that glass so often?”</p>

<p>“I only want a look at a gentleman now and
then,” was the student’s calm reply.</p>

<h3>The Fifth Drink</h3>

<p>Student:—“I drink too much! Why,
mother, as a good son, I could not sleep without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
having drunk your health. Now the first
glass is for the alma mater; the second, for the
professors; the third, for science in general and
my special study; the fourth, I must drink to
father’s health, so it’s only the fifth that I can
drain in your honor!”</p>

<h3>A New Treatment</h3>

<p>Professor:—“How do you treat the epidemic
diseases prevalent at the present time?”</p>

<p>Student:—“I treat them with the greatest
contempt.”</p>

<h3>An Ambiguous Amendment</h3>

<p>While the cholera was raging at M——, the
police issued an order that everybody who went
home after ten o’clock at night, must do so
without making any noise whatever, or pay a
fine of five gulden. One night several students
who had sat over their beer too long, went home
late, singing lustily. The nightwatchman at
once accosted them, and asked whether they
had not read the order that everybody must go
home without singing or making any other
noise?</p>

<p>“Of course we have read it,” said one of the
students, drily, “but we are not going home.”
This quick-witted answer confused the worthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
watchman, and he let them go. Next day the
following amendment was read under the order:
“Nobody is permitted to sing or make any
noise on the street at night, whether they are
going home or not.”</p>

<h3>A Repetition by Request</h3>

<p>A student who had failed in his final examination
at the University, returned home. At
dinner his father asked how his examinations
went.</p>

<p>“So well, that at general request, I have to
go all through them again shortly.”</p>

<h3>He Drank Beer</h3>

<p>Professor (examining a student):—“And how
do you guard yourself against impure water?”</p>

<p>Student:—“First, I boil it; secondly, I
filter it!”</p>

<p>Professor:—“And thirdly?”</p>

<p>Student:—“I drink beer.”</p>

<h3>One Was Enough</h3>

<p>“You are engaged to be married to one of
your fellow-students, Suffel?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; one of us is sure to pass the examination,
and that is enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<h3>Preferred Something Stronger</h3>

<p>Gentleman:—“Don’t you drink water?”</p>

<p>Student:—“Never; I tried it once, and
almost drowned.”</p>

<h3>Two Alike</h3>

<p>Among students. “What a spendthrift that
Spund is! Day before yesterday was the
‘First,’ and when I wanted to borrow from him
to-day, he hadn’t a pfennig.”</p>

<h3>Ridiculous Idea</h3>

<p>Father (to his son, an extravagant student):—“What?
You want to start a coin collection?
That looks to me about as funny as
it would if our poodle started a sausage collection!”</p>

<h3>Double Dodging</h3>

<p>1st Student:—“Where do you have your
clothes made, Spund?”</p>

<p>2d Student:—“Meyer and Strauss.”</p>

<p>1st Student:—“I should never get a double
firm to work for me. Instead of having to
dodge only one creditor, you have to dodge
two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<h3>With Intent</h3>

<p>Student:—“Grandmother, you must have
been a beautiful girl once!”</p>

<p>Grandmother (taking her pocketbook from
her pocket):—“How much do you want for
your bout to-night, you rascal?”</p>

<h3>She Knew Students</h3>

<p>Student (renting a room):—“Shall I pay
the rent in advance, Frau Muller?”</p>

<p>Landlady:—“No, never mind; I’ll save
you the trouble of having to borrow it again
from me.”</p>

<h3>Impossible</h3>

<p>Fräulein:—“... And you risked your life
gathering those Alpine roses for me? Now
just tell the truth, you bought them?”</p>

<p>Student:—“Oh, but gracious Fräulein, how
could I—at the end of the month?”</p>

<h3>Was Prepared</h3>

<p>Uncle (before examination):—“Are you
prepared, Karl?”</p>

<p>Student:—“Oh yes, for the worst.”</p>

<h3>Worse Than He First Thought</h3>

<p>Student (at a tavern hunting for his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
overcoat):—“My overcoat has been stolen! Well,
the thing isn’t worth much. Luckily the tailor
has not been paid yet, but there were fifty
pfennigs in the pocket! It’s a perfect outrage!”</p>

<h3>Different Ways of Wooing</h3>

<p>The Diplomat says:—“Oh, let us form an
everlasting alliance.”</p>

<p>The Soldier:—“You gave my heart an
incurable wound; or ‘you came; I saw; you
conquered.’”</p>

<p>The Doctor:—“Only you can cure my suffering
heart.”</p>

<p>The Florist:—“Just one word from your
lips and our path through life shall be strewn
with roses.”</p>

<p>The Builder:—“Let us plan our cottage together.”</p>

<p>The Sailor:—“Loveliest maiden, united to
you, I could brave all the storms of life.”</p>

<p>The Jeweler:—“This single band shall form
a golden chain.”</p>

<p>The Scientist:—“Ah, let me explore your
heart and read my happiness in your eyes.”</p>

<p>The Sculptor:—“If your heart is not of
marble, let my image dwell therein.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>The Baker:—“Will you share my bread in
joy and sorrow?”</p>

<p>The Candlemaker:—“You shall be the light
of my life.”</p>

<h3>A Pretty Compliment</h3>

<p>Lady:—“The gentleman will surely buy this
small bouquet!”</p>

<p>Gentleman:—“Certainly, madam, how much
is it?”</p>

<p>Lady:—“Suppose we say twenty marks?”</p>

<p>Gentleman:—“Madam, that is too dear for
me!”</p>

<p>Lady (pressing a kiss on the flowers):—“And
now, sir?”</p>

<p>Gentleman (turning away):—“Now it is altogether
beyond my means.”</p>

<h3>A Habit of His</h3>

<p>“My lady, there is a gentleman down-stairs,
who wishes to see you!”</p>

<p>“Did he not give you his name?”</p>

<p>“No; he said it was not necessary.”</p>

<p>“You do not know him?”</p>

<p>“No; he pinched my arms and cheeks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is my brother Gustave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<h3>Tender-hearted</h3>

<p>Young Housewife:—“Why Nanny, how can
you be so heartless as to throw those poor lobsters
at once into boiling water? They ought to
be put on in fresh water so they could get used
to the heat by degrees!”</p>

<h3>When the Tide Comes In</h3>

<p>He:—“I am going to take a bottle of sea-water
home with me as a souvenir from Norderney!”</p>

<p>She:—“But don’t fill it quite full, or it will
burst on us when the tide comes in.”</p>

<h3>Malady to Suit the Place</h3>

<p>“So that is why you are in the dumps, my
dear; you want to go to Wiesbaden, and are
ordered to Ems. Don’t be offended, but if
ever I pay a yearly salary to my family physician,
and should want to go to a certain watering
place, I would see that he found the proper
malady for it.”</p>

<h3>He Knew</h3>

<p>Father:—“Karl, the stork brought you a
little brother last night.”</p>

<p>Karl:—“I know it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>Father:—“How’s that?”</p>

<p>Karl:—“I heard you say to the stork as he
flew away, ‘Won’t you take an umbrella; it is
raining very hard.’”</p>

<h3>A Protection</h3>

<p>Lady:—“Were you not afraid to travel with
your wife through the Abruzzen?”</p>

<p>Gentleman:—“Oh no! my mother-in-law
always sat with the driver.”</p>

<h3>Would Change His Mind</h3>

<p>“I assure you, my friend, my son is dead in
love with that actress. He has told me repeatedly
that he could not live without her.”</p>

<p>“Well, then let him marry her, and he will
soon learn to!”</p>

<h3>Retaliation</h3>

<p>A farmer had worked all day in the field in
storm and rain, and in the evening, came home
very tired, and wet to the skin. At the door,
his dear wife who had been in the house all day
met him, and said: “Dear husband, it has been
raining so hard that I could not fetch any water,
and so was not able to cook a soup for you.
Since you are so wet, fetch a couple of pails;
you can’t get any wetter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>There was no disputing this fact, so the man
took the pails and went to the distant pump.
When he returned to the house, his wife sat
cozily by the fire; so he took one pail after the
other, poured the water over his wife and said:
“Now you are just as wet as I am, and you can
fetch the water yourself. You can’t get any
wetter.”</p>

<h3>Suited the Case</h3>

<p>Sophie (to her elderly maiden aunt):—“Auntie,
is not ‘to leave’ conjugated: I leave,
I left, I have been left?”</p>

<h3>A Worthy Setting</h3>

<p>Women are the pearls of creation, and, as
such, expect to be set in gold.</p>

<h3>Women’s Rights</h3>

<p>Since the fair sex has been talking so much
about women’s rights, there are fewer of the
“right women” on earth.</p>

<h3>Depends on the Age</h3>

<p>When the suitor appears, the belle of seventeen
asks: “Who is he?”—of twenty-five:
“What is he?”—and after ten years more:
“Where is he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<h3>Extract From a Love-Letter</h3>

<p>“Beloved Anton! I waited in the rain for
you to-day at the corner. I hope you have been
ill. Shall come again to-morrow. Your true
Anna.”</p>

<h3>Economical Unhappiness</h3>

<p>Wife:—“I don’t know what is the matter
with our Clara; she does not wish to go to the
balls; she is indifferent to dress; the theatre no
longer gives her pleasure; and now she even refuses
to go to a watering-place for the summer.
The girl must love unhappily.”</p>

<p>Husband:—“Good gracious! how economical!
Sarah, could not you love me unhappily
for once?”</p>

<h3>Not What He Expected</h3>

<p>Admirer:—“It gives me the most exquisite
pleasure to hear you say that you discover daily
how much I am like your sainted husband.
Might I ask in what I resemble him?”</p>

<p>Young widow:—“You have all his bad habits.”</p>

<h3>To Please Him</h3>

<p>Husband:—“You are lovely in this dress,
that is true, but—the money!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>Wife:—“That does not count, when the object
is to please you!”</p>

<h3>Must Scream</h3>

<p>Gentleman:—“But, ladies, this loud talking
during the concert is abominable!”</p>

<p>Lady:—“I fully agree with you. One must
actually scream, to make oneself understood.”</p>

<h3>The Newest</h3>

<p>“You wish a New Testament, madam?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but, please, the very newest.”</p>

<h3>Painted Angels</h3>

<p>Mother:—“My daughter does not please
you?”</p>

<p>Gentleman:—“To tell the truth, I do not
care for paintings.”</p>

<p>Mother:—“Pardon me, but did you ever see
an angel, other than painted?”</p>

<h3>No Economy Necessary</h3>

<p>Cook:—“Miss Helene, please, shall I put a
pinch of paprika into the chicken-stew?”</p>

<p>Miss Helene (just back from boarding-school):—“Why,
Anna, you do not have to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
so economical here; put a good big tablespoonful
into it.”</p>

<h3>Ignorant Professor</h3>

<p>Lady:—“Do tell me, Professor, why we are
called the fair sex?”</p>

<p>Professor:—“Well, I am sure I don’t know
either.”</p>

<h3>The Flirt</h3>

<p>“... Oh, who dares to deny it! She
knows how to chain the men! And yet—caprice
of nature—she never can chain one
man!”</p>

<h3>The Convenient Grandmother</h3>

<p>Young Lady:—“Can I get a guide to write
love-letters here?”</p>

<p>Clerk:—“For yourself?”</p>

<p>Young Lady (embarrassed):—“For myself?—oh,
no! for—my—grandmother!”</p>

<h3>Sharpening His Teeth</h3>

<p>A housemaid was ordered to go to a guest’s
room to tell him that dinner was ready. She
found him standing before the looking-glass,
tooth-brush in hand, cleaning his teeth. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
gave her message, and on returning to her mistress,
said, “The gentleman will come at once;
he is just sharpening his teeth.”</p>

<h3>Butter, Then Cheese</h3>

<p>A butter-dealer and a cheese-monger were to
be godmothers at a christening. At church the
latter pushed herself into the place of honor,
next to the mother. But the butter-dealer
stepped in front of her saying, “Butter comes
before cheese.”</p>

<h3>Thoroughly Washed</h3>

<p>Young wife (fresh from boarding-school):—“Oh,
Kathi, what are you doing? That fish
does not need washing! Why he has been in
water all his life.”</p>

<h3>Forethought</h3>

<p>To a Banker. “Why do you let your daughter
marry your cashier?”</p>

<p>“Precaution, my dear sir; if he ever runs
away with the bank’s money, my daughter will,
in all probability, get some of it.”</p>

<h3>To Suit Her Mourning</h3>

<p>At a Ball. “May I ask for the first waltz?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly—but please, Doctor, dance a
little slower; I am still in mourning.”</p>

<h3>Inhospitality</h3>

<p>Lady:—“But John, my guests drank only
three bottles of champagne yesterday, and here
are four missing.”</p>

<p>John:—“Did they drink only three? Well,
I didn’t count them,—I don’t think it is nice to
watch one’s guests.”</p>

<h3>Too Literal</h3>

<p>Intended Husband:—“You know, Bertha,
I would go to the end of the world for you!”</p>

<p>Fiancée:—“Then, please, stay a few days
longer with us.”</p>

<p>Intended Husband:—“Why, my dear Bertha,
I should lose my return ticket!”</p>

<h3>A Fatal Mistake</h3>

<p>Doctor’s Wife:—“Why, my dear husband,
what are you so dreadfully excited about?”</p>

<p>Doctor:—“Just think of it! By mistake I
signed my name under the question, ‘Cause of
death,’ in a death certificate!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<h3>Her Faulty Geography</h3>

<p>An Eskimo family was being exhibited at the
zoölogical gardens. The young wife of an
Army officer who had taken her there, asked
them, “How do you like it in Berlin?” and as
the Eskimos kept silent, not understanding
her, the talkative little woman went on, “Don’t
you think it’s nicer here, than in Eskimo?”</p>

<h3>A New Composer</h3>

<p>Lady:—“Dear Emilie, by whom is this magnificent
piece, that is being played?”</p>

<p>Emilie:—“I think it is by ‘Da Capo,’ an
Italian composer, who has written a great many
pieces.”</p>

<h3>Eels by the Yard</h3>

<p>Young Housewife (helping the cook prepare
the menu for a dinner-party):—“As second
course, we will have baked eel.”</p>

<p>Cook:—“How much shall I order, my
lady?”</p>

<p>Young housewife:—“I think ten yards ought
to be enough.”</p>

<h3>A Hint</h3>

<p>“Say, papa, when I am a papa, I’ll make
Liesel roast a goose for me, too; but I shall
give my little boy some of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<h3>A Young Lady’s Diary on an Ocean Steamer</h3>

<p>First Day. Stormy weather; poor company.</p>

<p>Second Day. Captain very amiable; offers
me his heart and hand. Refused.</p>

<p>Third Day. Captain renews his offer.
Threatens to kill us both and to blow up the
vessel with three hundred souls on board. Refused.</p>

<p>Fourth Day. Saved three hundred lives.</p>

<h3>Toast to Women</h3>

<p>“The ladies lessen our sorrows, double our
joys, and treble our expenses. Long may they
live!”</p>

<h3>A Precaution</h3>

<p>“Auntie, do you like chocolates?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, little one, I love them!”</p>

<p>“Ah! Then I had better ask grandmamma
to take care of my box of bonbons.”</p>

<h3>A Novice in Gardening</h3>

<p>Husband:—“Just think, little wife, I saw
the first asparagus in the garden. Would it
give you pleasure to cut it yourself?”</p>

<p>Young Housewife (trying to hide her ignorance
in this direction):—“I tell you what,
Adolf; we’ll go together. You pick it off,
while I hold the ladder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<h3>Poor Memory</h3>

<p>Servant:—“Will you please tell me, madam,
where you buy your sausages?”</p>

<p>Mistress:—“On Humboldt Street.”</p>

<p>Servant:—“I am afraid I can’t remember
that.”</p>

<p>Mistress:—“Just think of the Kosmos.”</p>

<h3>A Different Meaning</h3>

<p>Bride:—“What is the name of that beautiful
star over there?”</p>

<p>Bridegroom:—“That is Venus.”</p>

<p>Bride:—“What does it mean?”</p>

<p>Bridegroom:—“The happiness of love!”</p>

<h3>Twenty Years Later</h3>

<p>Wife:—“What is the name of that beautiful
star over there?”</p>

<p>Husband:—“It’s the evening star; don’t
know the name of it.”</p>

<p>Wife:—“Do you know what it means?”</p>

<p>Husband:—“That it is getting night.”</p>

<h3>Hard on Him</h3>

<p>A flirt is a rose, of whom each plucks a
leaf; the thorns remain for the future husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<h3>Her Idea of Rome</h3>

<p>Gentleman:—“You were some time in Italy,
Baroness; how did you like Rome?”</p>

<p>Baroness:—“Rome? Just wait a moment!
(To her daughter.) Emma, was it not at Rome
where we bought those poor gloves?”</p>

<h3>Misunderstood</h3>

<p>Baroness (returning home):—“Maria, I cannot
suffer you to take your sweetheart into the
kitchen!”</p>

<p>Cook:—“Your ladyship is very kind, but
my sweetheart would not go into the salon!”</p>

<h3>Not Men Pleasers</h3>

<p>Husband:—“I wish you would tell why you
women are forever dressing up and have to have
such a lot of new clothes all the time; do you
think such extravagance pleases the men?”</p>

<p>Wife:—“Oh, we don’t care to please the
men; we want to make the other women jealous!”</p>

<h3>Depends on the Kind</h3>

<p>Little Fritz (to the cook):—“Anna, how do
you spell ‘sauce’?”</p>

<p>Cook:—“Sauce? Well, you see, Fritz, there
are so many different kinds of sauce!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<h3>A Question of Likes</h3>

<p>Gentleman:—“Mein Fräulein, do you like
sauerkraut?”</p>

<p>Fräulein:—“Why, what a queer question to
ask me!”</p>

<p>Gentleman:—“Well, you see, I love the
little sausages that go with it, so if you liked
sauerkraut, we should match beautifully.”</p>

<h3>Thought for the Future</h3>

<p>Professor:—“Well, dear Elise, after passing
such a brilliant examination, I suppose you will
settle down at once to practice law?”</p>

<p>Student:—“Oh, no, I am going to enter the
government service; else my future husband
would not receive a—pension.”</p>

<h3>Conclusive Evidence</h3>

<p>A little girl was heard holding the following
monologue:</p>

<p>“Did God really make the whole world? I
couldn’t do it. It must have been dreadfully
hard. But I know one thing He didn’t make,
this washrag of my doll’s; I knitted that myself,
the dear Lord can’t knit.”</p>

<h3>Misery Loves Company</h3>

<p>Little Carl had been scolded a good many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
times for dropping and breaking things. One
day his mother happened to drop and break a
cup. “Why, mother, now you are a naughty
boy, too!” exclaimed the little one.</p>

<h3>Uncle and the Donkey</h3>

<p>There is nothing like a jolly and good-natured
uncle in a family. What fun the children
have with him! Just now they are all hanging
around him waiting for what is coming next.</p>

<p>“Now, young gentleman,” he says to the
oldest, “I am going to give you a riddle. It is
gray, has rather large ears, and you can ride on
it; what is it?”</p>

<p>“Why uncle, that is you,” cries the youngest,
joyfully.</p>

<h3>The Unsuccessful Ruse</h3>

<p>Little Anna was ill in bed, and could not be
induced to take her pill. Her clever mamma
hid it in a preserved pear and gave her that.
After a while she asked: “Well, my darling,
have you eaten your pear?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, mamma,” answered the little one,
“all but the pit.”</p>

<h3>An Ancient Fowl</h3>

<p>Elsie (who, with her mamma, is dining off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
a very tough chicken at a railway station):—“Mamma,
don’t you think this chicken must
have been hatched from a hard boiled egg?”</p>

<h3>A Classical Maid</h3>

<p>Lady:—“Has the Baron not been here yet
to-day?”</p>

<p>Maid:—“Everything has been here once,”
says Lessing, “but—the Baron has not been
here yet.”</p>

<h3>From the Diary of a Singer</h3>

<p>Monday:—“Aïda.” Starved with my lover
in the prison cell.</p>

<p>Tuesday:—Sang “Gilda” in “Rigoletto.”
Was murdered and dragged from the stage in a
bag.</p>

<p>Wednesday:—In “Traviata” I sang “Violetta,”
and coughed virtuos-tuberculos, my
life away.</p>

<p>Thursday:—As “Selika” (in l’Africaine)
died from the poisonous odor of the Manzanillen
tree.</p>

<p>Friday:—Sang the “Jewess,” and as a <i>finale</i>
was thrown into a kettle of boiling oil.</p>

<p>Saturday:—As “Sulamithe” in the “Queen
of Saba” was suffocated in the Simoom of the
desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>Sunday:—“Hamlet” and I as “Ophelia”
drowned—under a storm of applause—in the
brook. How beautiful it is, to be able to
devote one’s art and one’s life to give <i>pleasure</i>
to one’s fellow-men!</p>

<h3>Deep Mourning</h3>

<p>Count:—“Gracious lady, are you not dancing
to-night?”</p>

<p>Lady:—“Not till after midnight, Count.”</p>

<p>Count:—“Why not until then?”</p>

<p>Lady:—“Because to-day is the anniversary
of my husband’s death.”</p>

<h3>Without Nerves</h3>

<p>Mother (coming home, meeting her children):—“Why,
children, how you do look; where
have you been?”</p>

<p>Walter:—“At the Major’s, across the street,
mamma, and didn’t we have a great time
playing!”</p>

<p>Elsa:—“And just think, mamma, Clara’s
mother has no nerves at all!”</p>

<h3>Unaccountable Stupidity</h3>

<p>Fanny had succeeded in coaxing her mother
to take her to hear “Lohengrin.” During the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
performance she turns to her mother and says:
“Why, mamma, how stupid of Elsa to ask
Lohengrin his name, when all she had to do
was to look at the program!”</p>

<h3>A Gentle Hint</h3>

<p>“Ah, sir, if ever I should have grandchildren,
I could not wish them a better father
than yourself!”</p>

<h3>A Suggestive Question</h3>

<p>“So sad to-day, Miss Alice?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I am very unhappy!”</p>

<p>“May I ask why?”</p>

<p>“Papa told me just now, that we are going
home to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Am I perhaps the happy one, on whose
account you are so very unhappy?”</p>

<h3>The Swan Song</h3>

<p>“Is it true, mamma, that swans sing before
they die?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my child! but come, stop feeding them
or you will make them ill.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I want to do. I am going
to feed them till they die. I do want to hear a
swan-song, so much!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<h3>A Slight Misunderstanding</h3>

<p>“So you have but just returned from a trip
to Paris! You visited the Louvre, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly, was so delighted with it, that
I went all over it!”</p>

<p>“And which one of the many magnificent
pictures pleased you most, Baroness?”</p>

<p>“Pictures? I did not see any pictures; the
velvet coats charmed me most!”</p>

<p>“Ah, then you were at the dry-goods store
‘Louvre’!”</p>

<p>“Why, where else did you think?”</p>

<h3>The Boy Understood</h3>

<p>Minister (who has a few boy boarders):—“So
you have sunk so low, Fritz, as to steal my
milk from the cellar! But who is it, from
whom you can conceal nothing; who sees
everything; before whom I myself am nothing
but a grain of sand?”</p>

<p>Fritz (weeping):—“Your wife, sir!”</p>

<h3>A Child’s Request</h3>

<p>The mother, on leaving the room, warns her
little daughter: “Don’t think of taking a pear
from the basket when I am gone; you know,
little one, that if I cannot see you, the dear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
Lord can.” Mother gone, the little girl can’t
resist the temptation, and looking up to heaven,
she says, in a pleading voice: “Dear Lord,
do please turn around!”</p>

<h3>The Order of Things</h3>

<p>“Mamma, I know how things in this world
are ordered,” said little Bertha, who had just
administered a severe rebuke to her doll. “The
doll must mind me; I must mind the nurse;
the nurse must mind you; you must mind papa;
papa must mind the Emperor; the Emperor
must mind God; and God——” here she
stopped, thought a moment, and then said decidedly—“and
God must mind Bismarck.”</p>

<h3>A Large Hood</h3>

<p>“The dear Lord must wear a very large
hood, mamma!”</p>

<p>“Why so, child?”</p>

<p>“Because at school we always pray:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Make us, dear Lord, pious and good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And take us all beneath Thy hood!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Not to Her Liking</h3>

<p>A pretty little girl was often hurt by the way
the neighbors and servants talked about her red
hair. One day her grandmother tried to comfort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
her, saying: “Dear child, God made
your hair, and everything He does is well
done.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but then I would rather He would not
make anything more for me,” declared the
little one.</p>

<h3>Her Fears</h3>

<p>Little Elsie was at a children’s party with her
nurse. In the evening there were fireworks set
off. When the first sky-rocket went up, the
child began to cry bitterly, calling to her nurse
in a voice full of fear, “They are shooting
the dear Lord!”</p>

<h3>Only the Repair Angel</h3>

<p>Lieschen, on Christmas day with her new
doll:—“See, Hannchen, what a beautiful new
doll the Christ-child has brought me!”</p>

<p>Hannchen (with an old, but repaired doll):—“My
mamma said that only the repair angel
came to us this year.”</p>

<h3>A Question of Belief</h3>

<p>At the examination the children were to say
the creed before the superintendent. It was
practiced so that three children were each to
say one article.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>The first began: “I believe in God the
Father——”</p>

<p>The superintendent skipped the second, and
asked the third: “Go on, child!”</p>

<p>“I believe in the Holy Ghost!”</p>

<p>“No; I believe in Jesus Christ!”</p>

<p>“No I don’t believe in Him. He believes in
Him,” said the boy, pointing towards his overlooked
neighbor.</p>

<i>Miscellaneous</i></h2>

<h3>A Rope Without End</h3>

<p>Two sailors were winding up a rope, and did
not finish as quickly as they expected.</p>

<p>“Where in the world,” cried one of them impatiently,
“is that end?”</p>

<p>“I bet,” returned the other, “they have cut
it off.”</p>

<h3>The Long Dressing-gown</h3>

<p>The wife of a well-known Berliner presented
him on his birthday with a dressing-gown.
Agreeably surprised, he tried it on, but found
that it was about six inches too long. In the
night a violent storm occurred. The anxious
wife arose and, to pass the time, took the
dressing-gown and shortened it. Then she retired
again.</p>

<p>Now, with the family lived a very active
sister-in-law, who was in the habit of rising
very early. On this morning she saw the
dressing-gown, and thinking to please her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
brother-in-law, she took it down and shortened
it six inches more. After breakfast the two
ladies went to market, and the husband, thinking
of his dressing-gown, before going to business,
ordered the cook to take it to the tailor,
and have it shortened about six inches. In the
afternoon the tailor returned it—a jacket with
tails.</p>

<h3>A Suabian Prussian-hater</h3>

<p>“We are nowhere, since we joined the Prussians;
we must be soldiers, we must pay taxes,
and we must keep our mouths shut!”</p>

<p>“Now, tell the truth, Hans; when were you
a soldier? When did you pay taxes, and when
did you ever keep your mouth shut?”</p>

<h3>Equal to the Occasion</h3>

<p>A clergyman living near Rastock, had an old
man, one of his farm-hands, drive him to
Warnemünde to inspect a man-of-war. On the
way he talked about the big vessel they were
going to see.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said his farm-hand, “I’ve seen a
vessel like that often enough.”</p>

<p>“Where did you ever see a man-of-war?”</p>

<p>“At Portsmouth, when my regiment was
shipped.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p>“How did you get to Portsmouth?”</p>

<p>“We came there from Quebec. I was stationed
in Canada a long time. Lots of Indians
there. They loafed around the streets, even
their color wasn’t like ours.”</p>

<p>“But how did you get there?”</p>

<p>“From Gibraltar, where it’s dreadfully hot,
and nothing is there but stones and rocks. Oh
yes, they’ve monkeys and loads of dust.”</p>

<p>“But how in the world did you happen to
strike Gibraltar?”</p>

<p>“Went with the Englishmen.”</p>

<p>“And how did you get among the Englishmen?”</p>

<p>The farm-hand scratched his head, grinned,
and said: “I ran away from here, because I
did not want to be a soldier.”</p>

<h3>The Last Train</h3>

<p>“Could you tell me when the last train for
Potsdam is going to leave?” asked a traveler of
his neighbor at the station.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he dryly, “I don’t suppose
either of us will live to catch it.”</p>

<h3>A Questionable Dish</h3>

<p>A German merchant dining with a Chinese
Mandarin at Hongkong, seemed to be very much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
pleased with the foreign dishes. He had just
been enjoying a roast, when the disquieting
thought struck him, that he might have been
dining off a cat, as he had been told that the
Chinese ate cats as well as rats. He determined
to find out. But unluckily the Chinaman
did not speak German, and the German
did not understand Chinese, so the latter pointed
at the dish saying: “Miau, miau!”</p>

<p>“Wow, wow!” said the Chinaman, shaking
his head.</p>

<h3>The Host Could Not Leave</h3>

<p>At a large evening party, one of the guests
stood in a corner yawning.</p>

<p>“Are you very much bored, sir?” asked his
neighbor.</p>

<p>“Yes, dreadfully,” was the answer. “And
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh I am bored to death too.”</p>

<p>“How would it do, to clear out together?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry I can’t; I am the host.”</p>

<h3>Proof Without Doubt</h3>

<p>“Say, do you think we need the sun more
than the moon?” asked one corner-lounger of
another.</p>

<p>“What a foolish question,” replied the other;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
“of course we need the moon more; it’s light
enough in daytime anyhow.”</p>

<h3>A Question of Numbers</h3>

<p>Professor (to a shepherd):—“A shepherd
once told me that black sheep eat a great deal
less than the white ones. I supposed he told
me a story?”</p>

<p>Shepherd:—“No, not at all!”</p>

<p>Professor:—“Well, how is that?”</p>

<p>Shepherd:—“Why, you know there are a
great many more white ones than black ones.”</p>

<h3>Difference of Opinion</h3>

<p>A young officer and a clergyman met at a
party. The former, intending to be witty, said:
“If I had a stupid son, I would make a clergyman
of him!”</p>

<p>The clergyman replied: “How opinions differ!
Your sainted father thought otherwise.”</p>

<h3>He Could Not Swim</h3>

<p>“Which one of you can swim?” asked a gentleman
who wished to be rowed across the lake.
At once a number of boatmen surrounded him,
crying:</p>

<p>“I, sir; I!” Only one remained at a distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>“Can you not swim?” he asked the man.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered the boatman.</p>

<p>“Then you are the one to row me over.”</p>

<h3>Gave What They Wished</h3>

<p>During war time a parson wished to rouse
his congregation to more enthusiastic patriotism,
so, when addressing them one day, he cried:
“Ha! Already I see the enemy coming, see
him enter your village, burn your homes, take
away your wives and daughters! Yes, they are
coming, they are near; do you see the flags waving?
Do you hear the beating of the drums?”
at the same time drumming on the pulpit with
both fists. Immediately the schoolmaster behind
the pulpit imitated the blowing of a bugle.
The parson turning around, whispered: “Schoolmaster,
what are you doing?”</p>

<p>“I am helping you, sir,” he replied. “I
know our farmers. Infantry alone won’t do;
you want cavalry too.”</p>

<h3>Located at Last</h3>

<p>In one of Munich’s streets, a crowd had gathered
around a little lost boy. He answered all
questions as to his name, where he lived, with:
“I don’t know.” There seemed nothing left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
to do, but to take him to the police station,
when some knowing fellow had a bright thought.
He planted himself in front of the boy saying,
“Now you just tell me, sonny, where do you buy
your beer?”</p>

<p>“At the Franziskaner,” was the quick reply.
There he was taken and was soon identified.</p>

<h3>A Wife’s Ten Commandments</h3>

<p>1. Beware of the first quarrel. When it
comes, fight it out bravely to the end; it is of
far-reaching consequence, that you should come
out victorious.</p>

<p>2. Never forget that you are married to a
man, not to a God; then his shortcomings will
not surprise you.</p>

<p>3. Do not pester him continually for money,
but try to get along with your weekly allowance.</p>

<p>4. If your husband should not possess a heart,
he undoubtedly owns a stomach; you will be
wise, if you try to gain his favor with well-cooked
food.</p>

<p>5. Now and then, not too often, let him have
the last word; it pleases him and you lose
nothing by it.</p>

<p>6. Read something besides the death and
birth-notices in the paper; it will surprise him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
occasionally, that he can talk about current
events and politics at home, without having to
go to the tavern for it.</p>

<p>7. Always, even when quarreling, be polite
to him. Remember that you looked up to him
before marriage; don’t look down on him now.</p>

<p>8. At appropriate intervals permit him to
know more than you do; it will preserve his
dignity, and it will be to your advantage to
acknowledge, now and then, that you are not
infallible.</p>

<p>9. Be your husband’s friend, if he is clever;
if he is not, try to elevate him to be yours;
never descend to his level.</p>

<p>10. Respect your husband’s relatives, particularly
his mother; she has loved him longer
than you have!</p>

<h3>Tempi Passati</h3>

<p>“I count on your taking part in our charity-concert,
Doctor. I have often had occasion to
admire your beautiful voice.”</p>

<p>“I regret exceedingly, sir, but since I have
been married I have no longer a voice.”</p>

<h3>Forgot His Name</h3>

<p>Professor Schnudlich (to letter-carrier):—“Any
letters for me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<p>Letter-carrier:—“What is your name?”</p>

<p>Professor:—“My—my—well now, I can’t
think of my own name! I am always forgetting
something! And my wife, Frau Professor
Schnudlich, is away too. She could tell
it to you instantly.”</p>

<h3>The Lion’s Share</h3>

<p>“How starved this lion looks, and yet the
city allows a lot of money for their food!”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose the keeper takes the lion’s
share.”</p>

<h3>A Pious Wish</h3>

<p>Lieutenant:—“Then you refuse me your
daughter’s hand, sir? Ah, would that my grief
might soften your heart!”</p>

<p>Banker:—“I am sorry, sir, but in this instance
I don’t follow my heart, but my brain.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant:—“And may I not hope for a
softening of the brain?”</p>

<h3>The End in Sight</h3>

<p>A tradesman punished his erring apprentice,
saying, at the same time, “How much longer
are you going to serve the evil one?”</p>

<p>The boy replied, “You ought to know best,
master; I believe my time is up in four months.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<h3>Flattering Likeness</h3>

<p>One beautiful summer afternoon, Herr Fraulich
decided to take his family for a drive on
the Prater in Vienna. After spending two hours
over her toilet his wife appeared at last, leading
their little son.</p>

<p>“Oh Kathi,” cried the husband, when he
saw them, “how could you dress the child up
like that! He looks simply crazy! I am not
going to take you out this way. I don’t want
people to think that I am parading a monkey.”</p>

<p>On this there was an exchange of sharp words,
but finally the husband gave in and they set out.
But on the stairs, Herr Fraulich, to spoil his
wife’s triumph, said, “You may say just what
you like, I stick to it—Franz looks just like a
monkey.”</p>

<p>At the house-door they met a friend. She
greeted them, kissed little Franz, and remarked:</p>

<p>“What an angel of a child your Franz is—the
very image of his father!”</p>

<h3>The Stove Smoked</h3>

<p>Servant:—“I am glad you like the room,
sir. I hope you don’t mind smoke!”</p>

<p>Gentleman:—“Oh no, I smoke a great deal
myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<p>Servant:—“That’s good; the stove here does
too.”</p>

<h3>A Novelty</h3>

<p>Dude:—“Pshaw! Life is stale! I believe
I’ll kill myself some day. But how?”</p>

<p>“Have a thought shoot through your head for
once.”</p>

<h3>A Wonderful Cure</h3>

<p>A gentleman who had trouble with his eyes
went to an oculist to have them examined.
The physician took the eye out, put it on the
table, and examined the socket. When he
turned around he was horrified to see the cat
in the act of swallowing the eye. He grabbed
her, carried her outside, took out one of her
eyes, and returning to the consulting room, replaced
the gentleman’s with the cat’s eye, and
told him to come back in a week.</p>

<p>When the patient returned the oculist asked
him if he could see.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he answered; “I can see by day
as well as by night.”</p>

<p>“Do you sleep well?”</p>

<p>“So, so! One of the eyes sleeps soundly,
but it’s strange, the other seems to be constantly
on the lookout for mice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<h3>No Apology Necessary</h3>

<p>A missionary was invited to a dinner at which
the daughters of the house appeared in low-neck
dresses. The host thought it necessary to
apologize for the fashion. “Oh,” said the
missionary, “I don’t mind it at all. I ought
to be used to it, having spent ten years among
the aborigines.”</p>

<h3>More Reliable</h3>

<p>Wife:—“I believe you love your pipe better
than you do me!”</p>

<p>Husband:—“Well, that doesn’t go out as
much as you do!”</p>

<h3>Easily Explained</h3>

<p>Son:—“Is it true, father, that there are people
living on the moon?”</p>

<p>Father (not wishing to betray his ignorance):—“Certainly,
son.”</p>

<p>Son:—“But what becomes of the people
when the moon wanes?”</p>

<p>Father:—“They wane too.”</p>

<h3>A Karlsbad Scheme</h3>

<p>“What doctor have you, Rosenthal?”</p>

<p>“What doctor? My neighbor in the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
room has a doctor. When he comes to see
him, I listen at the door, and whatever he
orders, I do. What need have I, then, to spend
a lot of good money on a doctor?”</p>

<h3>A Good Financier</h3>

<p>“Will you tell me, my dear friend, how you
manage, that you are never pressed for money,
but always have plenty of it?”</p>

<p>“That is very simple; I never pay old
debts.”</p>

<p>“But how about the new ones?”</p>

<p>“I let them grow old.”</p>

<h3>Why Eve Had no Servant</h3>

<p>“There is a great deal of talk about women’s
faults, and the reasons why they need so much
waiting upon. The question has even been
asked—by a man of course,—why the dear
Lord, in making Eve, from one of Adam’s ribs,
did not make a servant for her at the same
time.</p>

<p>“We are able to answer this question satisfactorily.
She simply did not need a servant.</p>

<p>“And why not? Because Adam never came to
Eve, lamenting over a pair of torn socks, asking
her to darn them, or with a shirt that had parted
company with its buttons, or with a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
ripped gloves that wanted mending at once.
Neither did he walk around in the mud smoking
cigars and then come back with boots that
needed blacking.</p>

<p>“Neither did he sit yawning behind a newspaper,
and, as soon as the sun went down, ask
gruffly: ‘Will supper be ready soon?’</p>

<p>“Instead of this, Adam lit the fire himself,
put the kettle on, pulled the radishes, pared the
potatoes, and, in general, did his duty. He
was satisfied with one dish, and did not
grumble, if Eve did happen to make a mess of
it for once. They didn’t bother with serviettes,
they used a palmleaf. He didn’t put a boiled
shirt in the wash every day. He milked the
cows and fed the chickens. He never brought
half a dozen friends to dinner, when one was
not in the least prepared for them. He did not
stay out late at night playing cards; it was not
necessary for Eve to sit up and worry. He
didn’t lounge around saloons, while Eve sat at
home rocking little Cain. He never scolded
and looked for his slippers in the corner where
‘he knew’ he had put them. When he took
off his boots, he put them in their place under
the fig-tree.</p>

<p>“In short—he did not think that Eve had
been created for the sole purpose of waiting upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
him; he did not harbor the fixed idea, that it
was degrading to a man to lighten his wife’s
burdens. These are the reasons, gentlemen,
why Eve had no need of a servant.”</p>

<h3>Would Suit Exactly</h3>

<p>A vivacious woman, who was talking to a
statesman about the Woman’s Rights question,
suddenly asked:</p>

<p>“What position would you give me if women
filled government positions as well as the
men?”</p>

<p>“I would give you the management of a
deaf and dumb asylum.”</p>

<p>“And why?”</p>

<p>“Because those unfortunates would either
have to learn to talk or you would have to learn
to keep silent.”</p>

<h3>Reason</h3>

<p>Reason is the only thing we can lose without
ever having possessed it.</p>

<h3>There Would Be No Use</h3>

<p>Gentleman:—“Don’t you love Heine?”</p>

<p>Old Maid:—“Why should I? The man is
dead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<h3>Good Advice</h3>

<p>“Waiter, close those windows; there is a
draught, and I am suffering with rheumatism.
I can’t have the door open, either, or my feet
get cold, and don’t you go and wipe those
tables, you’ll raise a dust and I have a cough!
My tea must not be strong either, as I am
nervous.”</p>

<p>“If I were you, I would go to a hospital and
be put in an incubator.”</p>

<h3>Appropriate to Men</h3>

<p>Gentleman:—“At fifty we may call the
ladies ‘old women,’ may we not, gracious
lady?”</p>

<p>Lady:—“Certainly, and many men much
sooner.”</p>

<h3>A Distinction</h3>

<p>Some one says of the residents of Munich:
“When they rise in the morning they are beer
barrels, and when they retire at night they are
barrels of beer.”</p>

<h3>Cheap Communication</h3>

<p>Father (to his son going on a long journey):—“Benjamin,
when you arrive at Krotoschin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
you needn’t waste any paper writing a letter.
I’ll give you a stamped envelope addressed to
me; you just mail that, and I’ll know that you
arrived safely.”</p>

<p>Son:—“Father, you can save the postage.
I’ll mail it without the stamp, and you just refuse
to take it.”</p>

<h3>Objected to Her Mother</h3>

<p>Mother:—“I wish you would tell me, Franz,
why you don’t want to marry Fräulein Neumann.
I tell you, the girl is a pearl.”</p>

<p>Son:—“That is quite possible, but I don’t
like the mother-of-pearl.”</p>

<h3>His Confession</h3>

<p>A thief while at confession, stole the confessor’s
watch.</p>

<p>“I have stolen,” declared the thief.</p>

<p>“Then you must give the stolen article back
to its owner,” said the priest.</p>

<p>“I will give it to you.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want it.”</p>

<p>“But if the owner won’t take it,” asked the
thief, “what shall I do then?”</p>

<p>“Then, in God’s name, keep it,” answered
the unsuspecting priest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<h3>A la Munchausen</h3>

<p>A:—“Look, on the weather-vane of that
church-tower sits a fly.”</p>

<p>B:—“Yes, I see him, and what’s more, he is
yawning just now, and has a hollow tooth in his
mouth.”</p>

<h3>He Found Them</h3>

<p>Three wags met an old Jew. “Good-morning,
Father Abraham!” cried the first. “Good-morning,
Father Isaac!” the second. “Good-morning,
Father Jacob!” the third.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, gentlemen,” said the
Jew; “I am neither Abraham, nor Isaac, nor
Jacob; I am Saul, who went to look for his
father’s asses, and I’ve found them, I’ve found
them!”</p>

<h3>A Horse-thief’s Excuse</h3>

<p>“You villain,” said the judge to the horse-thief,
just brought before him, “how did you
dare to steal a horse from the street, in the
middle of the day?”</p>

<p>“I steal a horse?” returned the thief. “Let
me tell your Honor, that in a very narrow
street a horse stood right in my way. I was in
a hurry, and wanted to drive him on in front<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
of me when a voice cried, ‘Take care, that
horse kicks!’ Then I tried to push past him,
and go my way, when somebody called out,
‘Hold on, that beast bites!’ Now what else
could I do, if I did not want to be bitten, but
to jump on him as quickly as I could? And I
had hardly touched the saddle when the impatient
horse takes the bit between his teeth and
runs. He took me fourteen miles, and that is
how I came to be here, your Honor. Now did
I steal that horse, or did that horse steal me?”</p>

<h3>The Henpecked Husband</h3>

<p>Doctor (to a patient whose wife died six
months before):—“You may live a good many
years yet, if you are careful.”</p>

<p>Patient:—“That’s all right, Doctor, but just
think of the reception my sainted wife will give
me if I keep her waiting so long.”</p>

<h3>Without Charm</h3>

<p>“Well, Louise, as the wife of such a promising
physician, you must lead a charming life!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! a very charming life, to sit all
day long, muffled up to my eyes, in the waiting
room, making believe I’m a patient!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<h3>The Janus Statue at Munich</h3>

<p>“Oh say, I like this statue!”</p>

<p>“So do I; just think of having two throats,
and to be permitted to carry the door-key!”</p>

<h3>Conscientious</h3>

<p>“Sarah,” said Moritz one morning to his
wife, “Sarah, offer me one hundred and fifty
marks for my hops!”</p>

<p>Sarah:—“Well, I offer you one hundred and
fifty marks for your hops.”</p>

<p>Moritz then went to the hop market where a
dealer offered him one hundred marks for his
crop.</p>

<p>“What,” cries Moritz, indignantly, “one
hundred marks! May the lightning strike me,
if I haven’t already been offered to-day one hundred
and fifty marks.”</p>

<h3>In the Laundry</h3>

<p>Neighbor:—“What in the world is your husband
doing in the laundry all morning?”</p>

<p>The Poet’s Wife (angrily):—“He is forever
writing his poetry on his cuffs! Now he is hunting
in the wash-boiler, for the fourth verse of his
last poem.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<h3>His Love for Lilacs</h3>

<p>“My wife is attention personified! Some
time ago I happened to mention that I loved all
lilacs—and what do you suppose I saw, when
my birthday came around?”</p>

<p>“Well—a beautiful bouquet of lilacs on the
table.”</p>

<p>“No, sir! My wife, in a new lilac dress!”</p>

<h3>His Mistake</h3>

<p>Herr Schanz, of Berlin, came to W. on a
pleasure trip. He stopped at the hotel “Krone,”
and was given a room on the third floor.</p>

<p>That night he started for home feeling a little
muddled. He lost his way, and strayed into the
hotel “Kronprince” on the same street, which
was only two stories high. When he reached
the second floor and saw the roof above him, he
shook his heavy head incredulously, and shouted
down the stairs, “Say, porter, what kind of a
monkey-shine is this? What’s become of that
third story?”</p>

<h3>Popularity—A Fable</h3>

<p>“You need not be so proud of your flowers,”
said the thorns to the rose-bush. “It is to us
you owe the greater part of your popularity!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<h3>Asked Too Much</h3>

<p>“What! your parents wish to force you to
marry that old banker!”</p>

<p>“Indeed they do, and what is more, they
want me to study medicine, as he is always ailing!”</p>

<h3>A Reliable Guide</h3>

<p>“Good gracious, fellow, did I not order you
to burn all my old love-letters, and here I find
them bound on your table?”</p>

<p>“Please excuse me, Captain, but my cook always
wanted a guide for love-letters, and so I
thought yours would do nicely!”</p>

<h3>An Adjustment of Accounts</h3>

<p>Host (to a stranger who is settling his account):—“I
am two marks short of your change.
Let me look at the account again, perhaps I can
think of something else to put down!”</p>

<h3>Claims to Greatness</h3>

<p>A:—“Who is the gentleman, to whom you
were speaking a while ago?”</p>

<p>B:—“Ah, that’s a great man! He is one of
the ten-thousand foremost writers of our day!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<h3>Caught</h3>

<p>Gentleman (in a cigar store):—“Can you
recommend that brand of cigars, ‘Ne plus Ultra’
with a good conscience.”</p>

<p>Dealer:—“Certainly, sir; they are absolutely
perfect and remarkably cheap.”</p>

<p>Gentleman (smilingly lighting one of them):—“I
am very glad to hear you say so—all the
more, since you wrote to me, that they were not
fit to smoke, and not worth half the money I
charged you for them. I am the manufacturer!”</p>

<h3>A Shopping Aid</h3>

<p>“The best thing for us to do, my dear Edward,
will be to get an automobile. If we ride
up to the dry-goods store in one of these, we can
get enough goods on credit, so that we can live
well by simply pawning them.”</p>

<h3>The Very Latest</h3>

<p>“Since your future husband is so devoted to
all kinds of sports, I suppose you will make your
wedding trip in a balloon?”</p>

<p>“Why no, that is out of date,—in a submarine
vessel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span></p>

<h3>A Select Neighborhood</h3>

<p>“The people living in our part of the city are
of that class who can pawn their automobiles
during the carnival season.”</p>

<h3>Tricks of Fate</h3>

<p>“Well, how is your flying-machine progressing?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say, it fell into the ocean.”</p>

<p>“And how far along are you with your submarine
boat?”</p>

<p>“That flew up into the air!”</p>

<h3>Another Consideration</h3>

<p>“You must get an automobile, Rudolph!”</p>

<p>“Well, I might get one on credit—but how
about the benzine?”</p>

<h3>Each Had Its History</h3>

<p>A woman lawyer, showing her dresses, said,
“In this dress, my dear friends, I defended the
infamous murderer, Muller; in this, the well-known
burglar, Schlosser; in this, the clever
green-goods man, Shlapinski; and in this, I
represented the Countess Flirtinski, in her divorce
suit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<h3>Change of Disposition</h3>

<p>A:—“The young Baron seems a very harmless
sort of fellow.”</p>

<p>B:—“Not any more—he bought an automobile
yesterday.”</p>

<h3>Taking Man’s Place</h3>

<p>Professor:—“My wife tells me that Fräulein
Melanie is fairly in love with her automobile!
Another instance of man being replaced by a
machine!”</p>

<h3>Adding Insult to Injury</h3>

<p>Dealer (who has just been knocked down by
an auto):—“What do you think of that Baron!
First, he borrows my benzine, and then he runs
over me with his automobile!”</p>

<h3>It Could Accomplish Much</h3>

<p>Automobile Dealer:—“I can recommend
this motor of twelve horsepower; with it you
can run over the largest furniture van with
ease.”</p>

<h3>Ill-Luck</h3>

<p>“Why was your marriage put off?”</p>

<p>“Because when we autoed to be wedded,
we ran over the magistrate who was to tie the
knot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<h3>Modern Alternative</h3>

<p>“Papa, now let me tell you; either you buy
me an auto, or I’ll use you as the comic character
in my new novel.”</p>

<h3>The Lesser Danger</h3>

<p>Brakeman (to couple walking on the ties):—“Don’t
you know that it is not only forbidden,
but very dangerous, to walk on the ties?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not nearly so dangerous as on the
highway with all those red devils running
about.”</p>

<h3>Extended Payments</h3>

<p>“Automobile all right—well built!—How
much?”</p>

<p>“Seven thousand, five hundred marks.”</p>

<p>“Yearly payments?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good! I’ll take the auto with me! I’ll
pay one hundred marks per annum. My father
and grandfather both lived to be over seventy!”</p>

<h3>Much in Demand</h3>

<p>“Johann, has my husband returned from his
auto ride?”</p>

<p>“No, gracious lady, and the third policeman
has just been here, asking for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<h3>A Modern Dowry</h3>

<p>Father (to his daughter’s fiancée):—“Besides
the necessary outfit, we can give our
daughter only an automobile, a piano, and a
camera!”</p>

<h3>A Polite Gentleman</h3>

<p>“How did you come to buy an auto?”</p>

<p>“Well, it happened this way. I wanted to
get some delicatessen for supper, but made a
mistake in the shop door and got into an automobile
place, and as I didn’t want to be so impolite
and go off without buying something, I
just took an auto.”</p>

<h3>An Obedient Patient</h3>

<p>She:—“What does this mean? You just
consulted the doctor about your catarrh and
here you sit and drink beer all day long!”</p>

<p>He (smiling cunningly):—“Well, you see
the doctor forbid my smoking dry.”</p>

<h3>A Bad Position</h3>

<p>“If the Baron has so many debts, why doesn’t
he find a wealthy wife?”</p>

<p>“Ah, but his debts are so many that one
wife wouldn’t do any good at all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<h3>Laconic</h3>

<p>Young Lawyer:—“Was a client here?”</p>

<p>Clerk:—“One, I think, during the dinner
hour; your overcoat is missing.”</p>

<h3>The Life-Saver</h3>

<p>Housemaid (rushing into the artist’s studio):—“For
heaven’s sake, Herr Pempe, hide yourself—or
go away for a time at once! A while
ago there were six or eight gentlemen here, who
said they were the ‘hanging committee’ and
wanted you! I had hard work to get rid of
them, but they are coming back soon!”</p>

<h3>No Danger</h3>

<p>“I hope your lawyer is not going to let the
District-attorney intimidate her!”</p>

<p>“Goodness, no! She is his mother-in-law!”</p>

<h3>Inexperienced</h3>

<p>Husband:—“What did you do with yourself,
dear, while I was at the club?”</p>

<p>Wife:—“I was very industrious, I mended
all those horrid holes in your lion and tiger
skins.”</p>

<p>Husband:—“Why my dear child, what were
you thinking of! Those holes were my greatest
pride; they represented my best shots!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<h3>Cautious</h3>

<p>Cashier:—“To make you feel perfectly
secure, I’ll present you with my photograph.”</p>

<p>Banker:—“Haven’t you one without a
beard?”</p>

<h3>Not so Bad as Painted</h3>

<p>Malicious Painter:—“Just think, I received
three orders for portraits to-day!”</p>

<p>Friend:—“There, now you see, people are
not as bad as you paint them.”</p>

<h3>An Indirect Cure</h3>

<p>Doctor:—“Well, you seem to be quite well
again! Did you take my pills every day?”</p>

<p>Countryman:—“Oh, yes, I took them all
right. You see, it was this way, doctor. My
black hen got at the box of pills and ate them
all up. So I killed the hen and ate her, and so
I got well again.”</p>

<h3>A Practical Savings-bank</h3>

<p>“If I take my cod-liver oil nicely, mother
always gives me five pfennig.”</p>

<p>“And what do you do with so much
money?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother puts it into my bank and buys
more cod-liver oil with it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<h3>Anonym Did It</h3>

<p>Boy (to his father in a picture gallery):—“Father,
what kind of a painter is this
‘Anonym’ whose name is mentioned so often
in the catalogue?”</p>

<p>Father:—“What a foolish boy you are!
Anonym is a foreign word and means that the
painter wishes to be unknown for the present.”</p>

<p>Father (at home, several hours later):—“It
is perfectly dreadful the way you children
meddle with everything; there is no end to
your mischief! Now my beautiful meerschaum
pipe has been broken. Who did it?”</p>

<p>Boy:—“Anonym, father!”</p>

<h3>A Good Example</h3>

<p>Mother:—“Remember, Franz, it is very
naughty to lean on your elbows as you are
doing just now.”</p>

<p>Franz (pointing at a picture of the Sistine
Madonna hanging in the room):—“Oh, but
mother, those two angels there are doing the
same thing.”</p>

<h3>Pride of Birth</h3>

<p>Little Baroness:—“When people die they go
to heaven, do they not? and when a child dies
it goes to heaven too——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>Baroness:—“And is called an angel.”</p>

<p>Little Baroness:—“But, mamma, if one of us
should die we would be called ‘von angel,’ of
course?”</p>

<h3>Logic</h3>

<p>Child:—“Mamma is it true that people are
made of dust?”</p>

<p>Mother:—“Yes, my dear.”</p>

<p>Child:—“Are the negroes made of coal-dust,
then?”</p>

<h3>The Wrong Way</h3>

<p>A teacher took an apple from one of the
pupils, and after awhile, believing himself unnoticed,
ate it. The pupil began to cough.
“What is the matter with you,” asks the
teacher.</p>

<p>“Why, my apple went down the wrong way,
sir.”</p>

<h3>A Good Excuse</h3>

<p>Mother (to her six year old son):—“Fritz,
how did this happen? Your new trousers have
already several holes in them!”</p>

<p>Fritz:—“Oh, but mother, you can’t expect
me to be always looking out for what goes on
behind my back!”</p>
